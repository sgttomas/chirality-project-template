# AUDIT_AGENTS.md
> Compatibility alias: canonical rubric is `AUDIT_AGENT.md`. This file mirrors it to satisfy references expecting `AUDIT_AGENTS.md`.

**AGENT_* Coherence & Conformance Audit Rubric**  
**Canonical standard:** `AGENT_HELPS_HUMANS.md`. All other `AGENT_*.md` files must conform unless the canonical contains an internal contradiction that prevents system functionality (rare; minimal fix only).

---

## 0) How to use this rubric
Fill this rubric out **for every AGENT_*.md file** provided.

### Marking scheme (use everywhere)
For each checklist item, mark one:
- ✅ **Conforms** (matches v2 or correctly defers to it)
- ⚠️ **Partial** (mostly aligns; has ambiguity/drift; low-risk)
- ❌ **Non‑conformant** (contradiction, role drift, contract mismatch, safety/policy conflict)
- N/A **Not applicable** (frame not expected for this layer/file)

### Evidence rule (mandatory)
For every ⚠️ or ❌:
- Provide **one short excerpt** (≤ 25 words) from the file and location: `{filename — section heading}`  
- Provide the **canonical requirement** excerpt (≤ 25 words) and location: `{AGENT_HELPS_HUMANS.md — section heading}`  
- Provide a **conformance fix** (specific edit instruction; minimal change preferred)

### Severity
Assign severity per issue:
- **Blocker:** would cause unsafe behavior, permission misuse, persistent contradictions, or breaks the architecture boundaries
- **High:** changes outcomes or makes behavior unreliable
- **Medium:** causes confusion / inconsistent formatting / increased cost
- **Low:** style/wording drift with minimal behavioral effect

## 3) System-wide glossary mapping (cross-file)
As you audit, record synonyms/drifts here so the patch plan can converge vocabulary.

| Canon term (v2) | Variant term found | File(s) | Drift type (synonym / meaning change) | Fix (rename / define / defer) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

# 5) Issue log (system-wide)
Add one row per issue found (across all files). Reuse IDs in file worksheets.

| ID | Severity | File(s) | Type (Non-conformance / Drift / Gap / Redundancy / Ambiguity) | Symptom (behavior) | Evidence (≤25w + location) | Canon requirement (≤25w + v2 location) | Fix (minimal edit) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

# 6) Patch plan (system-wide)
## 6.1 Prioritized edit sequence
1.
2.
3.

## 6.2 Consolidation plan (single source of truth)
- Rules to centralize in v2 (if missing/unclear in v2):
- Rules to delete from other files and replace with reference to v2:
- Files to split/merge due to role confusion:

## 6.3 Optional patches
For each file with recommended edits, provide either:
- `unified diff` patch, or
- `BEGIN REWRITE / END REWRITE` for specific sections

## 7) Final coherence judgment
- Coherence score: High / Medium / Low
- Main risks if left unfixed:
- Expected behavior improvements after patch plan:
- Any required minimal fix to v2 itself (only if internally contradictory):
