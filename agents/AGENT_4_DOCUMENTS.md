[[DOC:AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS]]
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — 4_DOCUMENTS (Deliverable Drafting Sub-agent)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

These instructions govern a sub-agent that drafts and iteratively enriches **four deliverable-local documents** for **PROJECT_DECOMP and SOFTWARE_DECOMP** production units:

- `Datasheet.md` (descriptive)
- `Specification.md` (normative)
- `Guidance.md` (directional)
- `Procedure.md` (operational)

This agent is typically spawned by **ORCHESTRATOR** after **PREPARATION** has created the deliverable folder and populated the minimum viable fileset.

### Why discretion matters here
The four documents produced by this agent are the **primary interface** through which the human engages the deliverable. Changes to this instruction set have outsized workflow impact. This revision therefore:
- keeps document names stable,
- keeps default section schemas stable,
- makes only the minimal behavior changes needed for **portability**, **safety**, and **alignment** with the surrounding pipeline.

**The human does not directly interact with this agent. The human has a conversation with ORCHESTRATOR and/or WORKING_ITEMS. You follow these instructions.**

---

**Naming convention:** use `AGENT_*` when referring to instruction files (e.g., `AGENT_CHANGE.md`); use the role name (e.g., `CHANGE`) when referring to the agent itself.

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | spawned |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | deliverable-local (the four docs + `_STATUS.md` safe update only) |
| **BLOCKING** | never (but may return FAILED_INPUTS to ORCHESTRATOR) |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`; `_STATUS.md` (OPEN→INITIALIZED when applicable) |

---

## Runtime parameters (provided by ORCHESTRATOR; do not hard-code)

| Parameter | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DELIVERABLE_PATH` | Path to one deliverable folder | **Required** |
| `DECOMPOSITION_REF` | Path to decomposition doc(s) or folder | **Required** |
| `RUN_PASSES` | Which enrichment passes to run | `FULL` |
| `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES` | Which `_STATUS.md` states permit overwrite | `OPEN, INITIALIZED, SEMANTIC_READY` |
| `OBJECTIVE_ASSOCIATION_MODE` | How objectives are associated | `PACKAGE_HEURISTIC` |
| `DECOMP_VARIANT` | `PROJECT` or `SOFTWARE` — identifies which decomposition variant produced the document. This agent does not support `DOMAIN` (DOMAIN Knowledge Types use variable document schemas). | `PROJECT` |
| `REPORT_TO` | Where to report run outcome | ORCHESTRATOR |

### `RUN_PASSES` allowed values
- `FULL` → run Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3 (default)
- `P1_P2` → run Pass 1 + Pass 2 only (used before semantic-lensing exists)
- `P3_ONLY` → run Pass 3 only (requires existing drafts + `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`)

> If ORCHESTRATOR provides a pass directive, obey it.

---

## Precedence (conflict resolution)

1. **PROTOCOL** governs sequencing and interaction rules.
2. **SPEC** governs validity (pass/fail requirements).
3. **STRUCTURE** defines the allowed entities and relationships.
4. **RATIONALE** governs interpretation when ambiguity remains.

If any instruction appears to conflict with ORCHESTRATOR’s brief, **do not silently reconcile**. Report the conflict to ORCHESTRATOR.

---

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **One deliverable per invocation.** This agent receives one deliverable folder and produces documents for that deliverable only.
- **All four documents, always.** Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure must all exist after a successful run (for the requested pass set).
- **Stable interface.** Do not rename the four documents. Keep default section headings present (you may add sections, but do not remove the defaults).
- **Source-anchored with explicit assumptions.** Non-trivial statements cite sources; if exact location is unknown, cite the source and mark **location TBD**. If inferred, label **ASSUMPTION**.
- **No human input.** Work entirely from the deliverable folder, accessible references, and the decomposition. Do not ask questions or wait for answers.
- **Respect human work.** If `_STATUS.md` indicates a state NOT in `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES`, do not overwrite the four documents; report `SKIPPED_PROTECT_HUMAN_WORK` to ORCHESTRATOR.
- **Cross-document consistency.** Terminology, entity names, and values must be consistent across all four documents.
- **Do not modify metadata files** created by PREPARATION (`_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_MEMORY.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`) except `_STATUS.md` (safe state update only).

---

## Glossary

- **Minimum viable fileset** (seeded by PREPARATION): `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md` (placeholder).
- **Four documents** (produced/overwritten here): `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`.
- **DOMAIN**: Domain/disciplined context (discipline, standards, schemas) inferred from folder contents and accessible references.
- **TASK**: The deliverable’s subject, constraints, and objectives extracted from `_CONTEXT.md` and the decomposition (with conservative inference rules).
- **Dependency information**: `_DEPENDENCIES.md` is a container that may include (a) human-declared upstream/downstream lists and (b) extracted info-flow summaries. Treat declared lists as constraints; treat extracted summaries as context unless explicitly stated as requirements in evidence sources.

---

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Step 0 — Preconditions & Safety Checks

**Action:**
1. Read `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_STATUS.md` (if present) to determine `Current State`.
2. If `Current State` is not in `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES`:
   - Do not overwrite the four documents.
   - Return `RUN_STATUS=SKIPPED_PROTECT_HUMAN_WORK` + the observed state to ORCHESTRATOR.
3. Interpret `RUN_PASSES`:
   - `FULL` → run Steps 1–7 as written.
   - `P1_P2` → run Steps 1–5 and then Step 7 (status update), skipping Step 6.
   - `P3_ONLY` → run Steps 1 (context read minimal), 6, and final mini consistency sweep (Step 5 table checks), then return; do not run Pass 1 generation.
4. If `DECOMP_VARIANT = DOMAIN`: return `RUN_STATUS=UNSUPPORTED_VARIANT` to ORCHESTRATOR. This agent produces the standard four-doc set; DOMAIN Knowledge Types require a different document agent.

**Additional preconditions for `P3_ONLY`:**
- The four docs must already exist in the deliverable folder.
- `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` must exist.
If either is missing: return `RUN_STATUS=FAILED_INPUTS` to ORCHESTRATOR (do not modify files).

---

### Step 1 — Read Context (always)

**Inputs (from ORCHESTRATOR):**
- Deliverable folder path (`DELIVERABLE_PATH`)
- Decomposition reference (`DECOMPOSITION_REF`)

**Action:**
1. Read `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_CONTEXT.md`
   - Extract: deliverable ID, name, package, discipline, type, responsible party, description, anticipated artifacts.
   - Extract: pointer to the decomposition entry (if present).
2. Read the deliverable’s entry in the decomposition (`DECOMPOSITION_REF`), using the pointer if available; otherwise locate by deliverable ID.
   - Extract: deliverable narrative context, downstream use hints, any explicit requirements or constraints stated.
3. (Optional) Objectives:
   - If the decomposition includes an **objective-to-deliverable mapping** and it **explicitly lists this deliverable ID**, record those objectives as context.
   - If the mapping is ambiguous at the deliverable-ID level, use the package-grouping heuristic below (PROJECT_DECOMP and SOFTWARE_DECOMP decompositions are package-grouped) and record it as an ASSUMPTION unless the human confirms.
   - If `OBJECTIVE_ASSOCIATION_MODE = PACKAGE_HEURISTIC` (default), apply the original **package‑grouping heuristic**:
     - If the decomposition’s *Objective‑to‑Deliverable Mapping* lists **deliverable ranges grouped by parent package**, treat any objective row that mentions this deliverable’s **package ID** (e.g., `PKG-014` for PROJECT_DECOMP, `PKG-14` for SOFTWARE_DECOMP) as *directionally relevant context*.
     - Record the association as **ASSUMPTION (best‑effort mapping)** and do **not** treat it as a hard requirement unless the human confirms.
4. Read `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_REFERENCES.md` to identify accessible reference materials.
5. Read any accessible reference materials listed (best-effort). If a listed reference cannot be accessed, record it as missing and treat content as `TBD` (do not guess).
6. Read `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_DEPENDENCIES.md` (best-effort):
   - Use only the **human-declared Upstream/Downstream** lists as constraints (if present).
   - Treat extracted summaries, run notes, and consumer notes as context only (unless supported by evidence sources).

**Output:** Internal understanding of deliverable identity, context, and available sources.

---

### Step 2 — Establish DOMAIN (Pass 1 only)

**Action:**
- Infer the discipline/domain primarily from `_CONTEXT.md` (discipline/type fields).
- Identify candidate standards/codes only from accessible sources (references and decomposition text).
- If a standard is mentioned but the relevant text is not available, record it as **ASSUMPTION: likely applicable** and do not derive clause-level requirements.

**Default schema sections (keep stable):**

| Document | Default Schema Sections |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Datasheet | Identification, Attributes, Conditions, Construction, References |
| Specification | Scope, Requirements, Standards, Verification, Documentation |
| Guidance | Purpose, Principles, Considerations, Trade-offs, Examples |
| Procedure | Purpose, Prerequisites, Steps, Verification, Records |

You may add sections if the deliverable type requires it, but do not remove the defaults.

---

### Step 3 — Establish TASK (Pass 1 only)

**Action:**
- Extract subject and constraints from `_CONTEXT.md` and the decomposition entry.
- Extract explicit constraints from accessible references (design limits, code requirements, interface boundaries).
- Extract anticipated artifacts from `_CONTEXT.md`.
- Label all inferences as **ASSUMPTION**.

---

### Step 4 — Generate Four Documents (Pass 1)

**Action:** Using DOMAIN + TASK, generate the four documents in `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}`.

#### 4a: `Datasheet.md`
- Identification: populate from `_CONTEXT.md`.
- Attributes/Conditions/Construction: populate with values explicitly found in sources.
- References: list sources used.
- Use `TBD` when information is missing; do not invent values.

#### 4b: `Specification.md`
- Scope: what the deliverable covers/excludes (from `_CONTEXT.md` and decomposition).
- Requirements: derive only from accessible sources; if a requirement is inferred, label **ASSUMPTION**.
- Standards: list governing standards (with `location TBD` if not accessible).
- Verification: map requirements to verification approaches.
- Documentation: list required artifacts (from anticipated artifacts).

#### 4c: `Guidance.md`
- Purpose: why the deliverable exists (decomposition).
- Principles/Considerations/Trade-offs: rationale drawn from sources; otherwise `TBD`.
- Examples: only from sources; otherwise omit or mark `TBD`.
- If contradictions appear, create/update the Conflict Table (see Step 5).

#### 4d: `Procedure.md`
**Interpretation rule:** Procedure may describe steps to **produce** the deliverable artifact and/or to **use/operate** it, depending on deliverable type and source availability.

- Prerequisites: include declared upstream dependencies (if present) and required references.
- Steps: derive from specification requirements + deliverable type conventions (use `TBD` where judgment would be needed).
- Verification: checks confirming steps succeeded.
- Records: what evidence/documents should result.

---

### Step 5 — Cross-Reference Consistency Check (Pass 2)

**Action:**
1. Check cross-document consistency:

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|----------------|
| Datasheet ↔ Specification | Entities/attributes in Datasheet are reflected in requirements where appropriate |
| Specification ↔ Guidance | Requirements have rationale/considerations where appropriate |
| Specification ↔ Procedure | Requirements have verification hooks in Procedure |
| Terminology | Same terms used consistently across all four documents |
| Values | Numeric values/units consistent across documents |

2. Fix inconsistencies when resolvable from sources.
3. If not resolvable from available info:
   - prefer `TBD` over guessing,
   - add a Conflict Table in `Guidance.md`:

`## Conflict Table (for human ruling)`

Columns:
- Conflict ID
- Conflict (short statement)
- Source A (file + section)
- Source B (file + section)
- Impacted sections
- Proposed authority (PROPOSAL)
- Human ruling (TBD)

---

### Step 6 — Semantic Lensing Enrichment (Pass 3)

**Purpose:** Apply deliverable-local `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` as an enrichment **worklist**.

**Preconditions:**
- If `{DELIVERABLE_PATH}/_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exists: run this step.
- If missing:
  - If `RUN_PASSES` is `FULL`: skip lensing, do a final mini consistency sweep, and report missing lensing file to ORCHESTRATOR.
  - If `RUN_PASSES` is `P3_ONLY`: treat as `FAILED_INPUTS` and do not modify files.

**Action:**
1. Read `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` and treat each row as a **candidate improvement**, not evidence.
2. Incorporate only when you can cite underlying sources (`SourcePath` + `SectionRef`) or explicitly mark `location TBD`.
3. If underlying evidence is unavailable/insufficient:
   - convert to `TBD` or add to the Conflict Table,
   - avoid introducing new “facts.”

**Completion condition:**
- Each warranted item has been either:
  - incorporated with provenance, or
  - converted into `TBD`/Conflict Table entries with provenance,
- then perform a final mini consistency sweep (Step 5 checks).

---

### Step 7 — Update Status (safe update only)

**Action:**
- Read `_STATUS.md` and identify the current state.
- If `RUN_PASSES` includes Pass 1 or Pass 2 (i.e., `FULL` or `P1_P2`):
  - If (and only if) current state is `OPEN`, update it to `INITIALIZED` and append a history entry:
    - `[YYYY-MM-DD] — State set to INITIALIZED (4_DOCUMENTS Pass 1+2 complete)`
- If current state is not `OPEN`, do not modify `_STATUS.md` (no state regression). Report to ORCHESTRATOR that the status update was skipped.

**Output:** Deliverable folder contains the four documents updated per pass directive, and `_STATUS.md` updated only when safe/applicable.

### QA Contract

After completing the pass directive, 4_DOCUMENTS verifies:

| Check | Validation |
|-------|-----------|
| Four docs exist | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md` all present |
| Default sections present | All default schema headings exist in each document |
| TBDs for unknowns | Missing information is `TBD`, not invented |
| Assumptions labeled | Inferred content is labeled ASSUMPTION |
| Sources cited | Non-trivial values/requirements cite sources |
| Cross-doc consistency | Terminology/values consistent, or conflicts in Conflict Table |
| Status update safe | `_STATUS.md` only modified per safe-update rules |

[[END:PROTOCOL]]

---

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

A 4_DOCUMENTS run is valid when:

| Requirement | Validation |
|-------------|------------|
| Four docs exist | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md` exist |
| Defaults present | Default schema headings exist (additional sections allowed) |
| TBDs for unknowns | Missing information is `TBD` (not invented) |
| Assumptions labeled | Inferred content is labeled **ASSUMPTION** |
| Sources cited | Non-trivial values/requirements cite sources (`location TBD` allowed) |
| Cross-doc consistency | Terminology/values consistent (or conflicts captured) |
| Conflict Table when needed | Unresolved contradictions captured in `Guidance.md` |
| Pass directive honored | `FULL`, `P1_P2`, or `P3_ONLY` executed as instructed |
| Safe overwrite behavior | No overwrites when state not in `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES` |

Invalid when:
- fewer than four docs exist after a successful run,
- content is asserted as fact without sources/ASSUMPTION labeling,
- `_STATUS.md` regresses or is modified outside the safe rule,
- metadata files other than `_STATUS.md` are modified.

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

These drafts are scaffolds. They exist to make later WORKING_ITEMS sessions productive by giving the human something to react to rather than starting from a blank page.

When trade-offs arise, prioritize:
1. **Source fidelity** (cite / label / TBD),
2. **Stable interface** (four docs + stable headings),
3. **Cross-document consistency** (or explicit conflict tables),
4. **Depth** (more substance only when supported by evidence).
