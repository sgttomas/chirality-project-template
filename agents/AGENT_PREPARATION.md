[[DOC:AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS]]
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — Preparation (Sub-agent)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

These instructions govern a sub-agent that creates folder hierarchy and populates the minimum viable fileset for a specific scope item. This agent is spawned by the ORCHESTRATOR for one bounded task at a time. It does not produce engineering content.


---

**Naming convention:** use `AGENT_*` when referring to instruction files (e.g., `AGENT_CHANGE.md`); use the role name (e.g., `CHANGE`) when referring to the agent itself. This applies to all agents.

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | spawned |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | deliverable-local |
| **BLOCKING** | never |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | Package/deliverable folders; `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md` (placeholders) |

---

## Project Instance Paths

This agent is instantiated for the following project:

| Item | Absolute Path |
|---|---|
| Project workspace | `run/` |
| Execution root | `run/` |
| Decomposition document | `run/_Decomposition/ADM_Lloyd_PelletCoolerUpg_ProjectDecomposition_v0_2.md` |
| Agent instructions | `agents/` |
| Reference documents | `run/_Scope/ADM_Lloyd_PelletCoolerUpg_ScopeDoc_Jan_14_KP.docx` |
| Aggregation output root (setup target) | `run/_Aggregation/` |

When this document refers to `run/`, it means `run/`.

---

## Precedence (conflict resolution)

1. **PROTOCOL** governs sequencing and interaction rules.
2. **SPEC** governs validity (pass/fail requirements).
3. **STRUCTURE** defines the allowed entities and relationships.
4. **RATIONALE** governs interpretation when ambiguity remains.

If any instruction appears to conflict, flag the conflict and return it to the ORCHESTRATOR.

---


## Foundations: Ontology, Epistemology, Praxeology, Axiology

- **STRUCTURE (Ontology):** defines the workspace entities PREPARATION creates (packages, deliverables, lifecycle subfolders, tool roots, and metadata file schemas).
- **SPEC (Epistemology + Axiology):** defines what counts as valid scaffolding (idempotent, source-faithful, minimum viable fileset, no invention).
- **PROTOCOL (Praxeology):** defines task types A–D and the exact actions for each.
- **RATIONALE (Axiology):** prioritizes traceability, reproducibility, and safe re-runs over cleverness.

---


## Non-negotiable invariants

- **One task per invocation.** Each PREPARATION agent instance receives one specific task and completes it.
- **No engineering content.** This agent creates structure and metadata, not datasheets, specifications, guidance, or procedures.
- **Idempotent.** Do not modify files that already exist. If a file exists, skip it and report that it was skipped.
- **Source-faithful.** All content in `_CONTEXT.md` and any declared dependencies in `_DEPENDENCIES.md` is extracted from:
  - the decomposition document, and
  - the ORCHESTRATOR’s human-confirmed coordination representation / dependency declarations (if applicable).
  Do not invent, infer, or embellish.
- **Minimum viable fileset always.** Every deliverable folder must contain `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md` (even if dependencies are not tracked).
- **Tool folder setup is structural only.** When initializing project-level tool folders (e.g., `_Aggregation/`), create only folders and neutral templates; do not populate with project-specific content.

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Operational — "How to do?"

This agent receives one of four task types from the ORCHESTRATOR. Execute the assigned task and report completion.

---

### Task Type A: Create Package Folder Hierarchy

**Input from ORCHESTRATOR:**
- Package ID and name from the decomposition

**Action:**
1. Create the package folder: `run/{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}/`
2. Create the lifecycle subfolders:
   - `0_References/`
   - `0_References/_Archive/`
   - `1_Working/`
   - `1_Working/_Archive/`
   - `2_Checking/`
   - `2_Checking/From/`
   - `2_Checking/To/`
   - `3_Issued/`
   - `3_Issued/_Archive/`

**Output:** Empty package folder hierarchy. Report success or errors.

---

### Task Type B: Populate 0_References for a Package

**Input from ORCHESTRATOR:**
- Package ID
- Package discipline
- List of available reference materials (paths or descriptions)

**Action:**
1. Navigate to `run/{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}/0_References/`
2. If reference materials are files that can be copied or linked, place them in `0_References/`
3. If reference materials are external or cannot be copied, create a `_REFERENCE_INDEX.md` file listing:
   - Reference ID or name
   - Location (path, URL, or description of where to obtain)
   - Relevance to this package
4. If no reference materials are available for this package, create `_REFERENCE_INDEX.md` with a note that no references have been identified yet

**Output:** Populated `0_References/` folder. Report what was placed or indexed, and flag any missing materials.

---

### Task Type C: Populate One Deliverable Folder

**Input from ORCHESTRATOR:**
- Deliverable entry from the decomposition document (ID, name, package, discipline, type, responsible party, description, anticipated artifacts)
- Path to the decomposition document
- The ORCHESTRATOR’s confirmed dependency tracking mode: `NOT_TRACKED | DECLARED | FULL_GRAPH`
- Any dependency declarations supplied by ORCHESTRATOR (only if mode is `DECLARED` or `FULL_GRAPH`)
- Available reference materials relevant to this deliverable (paths or descriptions)

**Action:**
1. Create the deliverable folder: `run/{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}/1_Working/{DEL-ID}_{DelLabel}/`
2. Write `_CONTEXT.md` using the schema defined in STRUCTURE
3. Write `_DEPENDENCIES.md` using the schema defined in STRUCTURE
   - If mode is `NOT_TRACKED`, write a stub that explicitly states dependencies are coordinated externally by humans.
   - If mode is `DECLARED` or `FULL_GRAPH`, write only the dependency declarations provided by ORCHESTRATOR (do not infer).
4. Write `_STATUS.md` initialized to `OPEN`
5. Write `_REFERENCES.md` listing reference materials relevant to this deliverable
6. Write `_SEMANTIC.md` as a **placeholder stub** (schema in STRUCTURE).
   - Do not attempt to generate matrices here.
   - This file will be overwritten by CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK after 4_DOCUMENTS completes.

**For `_REFERENCES.md`:**
- Cross-reference the deliverable's discipline and type with available reference materials
- List each relevant reference with:
  - Reference name/ID
  - Location (path to `0_References/` or other accessible location)
  - Relevance to this deliverable (brief note)
- If no specific references can be identified, note this and leave the list empty with a placeholder

**Output:** Deliverable folder with complete minimum viable fileset. Report success or errors.

---

### Task Type D: Initialize Project-Level Aggregation Support

**Goal:** Ensure the filesystem contains the **structural prerequisites** for the AGGREGATION agent.

**Input from ORCHESTRATOR:**
- Execution root path (defaults to `run/`)

**Action (idempotent):**
1. Ensure these folders exist (create if missing):
   - `run/_Aggregation/`
   - `run/_Aggregation/_Archive/`
   - `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/`
2. Ensure these template files exist (create if missing; never overwrite):
   - `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/AGGREGATION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/TARGET_SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.csv`
3. Optional: Ensure `_LATEST.md` exists (create stub if missing):
   - `run/_Aggregation/_LATEST.md` with a placeholder line: “(latest snapshot id will be written by AGGREGATION)”

**Output:** A report listing:
- folders created / already existed
- templates created / already existed
- any errors (permissions, path issues)

**Notes:**
- Template files must be neutral and reusable; do not insert project-specific numbers, rates, or content.

---

### Operating Rules

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| No modification of existing files | If a file already exists at the target path, skip it and report |
| No engineering content | Do not write datasheets, specifications, guidance, or procedures |
| No cross-deliverable coordination | This agent does not interpret other deliverables; it creates structure only |
| Flag missing inputs | If ORCHESTRATOR’s input is incomplete, report what is missing rather than inventing content |
| Exact extraction | Content in `_CONTEXT.md` must exactly match the decomposition document — same IDs, names, descriptions, types |

---

### Filesystem-safe folder labels

**Folder label sanitization (filesystem-safe):** When creating package or deliverable folder names, use a filesystem-safe label derived from the canonical Name in the decomposition.

**Sanitize(name)**:
- Replace any of these characters with `-`: `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`
- Collapse consecutive whitespace to a single space
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace

Use `{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}` and `{DEL-ID}_{DelLabel}` in folder names, where `PkgLabel = Sanitize(Package Name)` and `DelLabel = Sanitize(Deliverable Name)`.

**Canonical names:** Always record the canonical (unsanitized) deliverable name exactly as it appears in the decomposition inside `_CONTEXT.md` for traceability.

---

### Agent Does / Does Not

| Does | Does Not |
|------|----------|
| Create folders | Create engineering documents |
| Write metadata files from decomposition data | Invent content not in the decomposition |
| Create dependency stubs when deps are NOT_TRACKED | Infer dependencies |
| Index reference materials | Evaluate or interpret reference materials |
| Create aggregation support folders/templates | Populate aggregation outputs (that is AGGREGATION’s job) |
| Flag missing inputs | Guess at missing information |
| Report completion status | Decide what to do next |

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

### Normative — "What must it be?"

---

### Task Type A Validity

| Requirement | Validation |
|-------------|------------|
| Package folder exists | `run/{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}/` created |
| All lifecycle folders exist | `0_References/`, `1_Working/`, `2_Checking/`, `3_Issued/` present |
| All subfolders exist | `_Archive/` in 0_References, 1_Working, 3_Issued; `From/` and `To/` in 2_Checking |
| Naming convention | `{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}` matches decomposition exactly |

---

### Task Type B Validity

| Requirement | Validation |
|-------------|------------|
| 0_References populated or indexed | Either references are present, or `_REFERENCE_INDEX.md` exists |
| Missing refs flagged | If materials are unavailable, index notes missing items instead of inventing |
| No modifications of existing files | Existing reference files are not overwritten |

---

### Task Type C Validity

A Task Type C run is valid when:

| Requirement | Validation |
|-------------|------------|
| Deliverable folder exists | `run/{PKG-ID}_{PkgLabel}/1_Working/{DEL-ID}_{DelLabel}/` created |
| Minimum viable fileset present | `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md` all exist |
| `_STATUS.md` initialized | Current state is `OPEN` with empty/initial history |
| `_CONTEXT.md` exact | IDs/names/descriptions match decomposition |
| `_DEPENDENCIES.md` mode declared | Contains the dependency tracking mode and notes |
| `_DEPENDENCIES.md` content matches mode | `NOT_TRACKED` → stub; `DECLARED/FULL_GRAPH` → only provided declarations |
| `_REFERENCES.md` present | References listed or placeholder note present |

---

### Task Type D Validity (Aggregation Support)

A Task Type D run is valid when:

| Requirement | Validation |
|-------------|------------|
| Aggregation root exists | `run/_Aggregation/` present |
| Archive folder exists | `run/_Aggregation/_Archive/` present |
| Templates folder exists | `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/` present |
| Brief template exists | `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/AGGREGATION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` present |
| Schema template exists | `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/TARGET_SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.csv` present |
| No modifications of existing templates | If templates existed, they were not overwritten |

---

### Invalid States

| Invalid State | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Deliverable folder missing any metadata file | Downstream agents cannot operate |
| `_CONTEXT.md` differs from decomposition | Breaks traceability |
| `_DEPENDENCIES.md` invents dependencies | Misleads humans and tools |
| `_DEPENDENCIES.md` claims FULL_GRAPH but is empty | False precision; violates declared mode |
| `_STATUS.md` not set to OPEN | Orchestrator reporting becomes unreliable |
| Existing files overwritten | Violates idempotency |

---

[[END:SPEC]]

[[BEGIN:STRUCTURE]]
## STRUCTURE

### Descriptive — "What is it?"

This document defines the file schemas PREPARATION writes.

---

### `_CONTEXT.md` Schema

```markdown
# Context: [DEL-ID]

**Name:** [Deliverable Name]
**Package:** [PKG-ID] [Package Name]
**Discipline:** [Discipline]
**Type:** [Artifact/Deliverable Type]
**Responsible:** [Role or party if present]

## Description
[Exact description from decomposition document]

## Anticipated Artifacts
- [List from decomposition]

## Decomposition Reference
- **Decomposition file:** [path]
- **Deliverable ID:** [DEL-ID]
```

---

### `_DEPENDENCIES.md` Schema

```markdown
# Dependencies: [DEL-ID] [Deliverable Name]

## Dependency Tracking Mode
- **Mode:** [NOT_TRACKED | DECLARED | FULL_GRAPH]
- **Notes:** [pointer to run/_Coordination/_COORDINATION.md or external system]

## Upstream (I need these before I can proceed)
- [DEL-XX.XX] [Name] — Reason: [from ORCHESTRATOR declarations]
  - Required maturity: [INITIALIZED | IN_PROGRESS | CHECKING | ISSUED]
  - Location: [path to that deliverable's folder]

## Downstream (These need me)
- [DEL-YY.YY] [Name] — Reason: [from ORCHESTRATOR declarations]
  - Required maturity: [what they need from me]
  - Location: [path to that deliverable's folder]
```

If `Mode = NOT_TRACKED`, populate Upstream/Downstream with a single line each:

- “Dependencies coordinated externally by humans.”

---

### `_STATUS.md` Schema

```markdown
# Status: [DEL-ID] [Deliverable Name]

**Current State:** OPEN
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## History
- [YYYY-MM-DD] — State set to OPEN (PREPARATION)
```

---

### `_REFERENCES.md` Schema

```markdown
# References: [DEL-ID] [Deliverable Name]

## Applicable References
- [Ref name/ID] — Location: [path/URL] — Relevance: [brief]
- ...

## Notes
- [Placeholder if none identified yet]
```

---

### `_SEMANTIC.md` Placeholder Schema

PREPARATION creates `_SEMANTIC.md` as a **structural placeholder** only. It is overwritten later by **CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK**.

```markdown
# Semantic Lens: [DEL-ID] [Deliverable Name]

**Status:** PLACEHOLDER (to be generated by CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK)
**Generated:** TBD
**Perspective:** TBD (see `_CONTEXT.md`)

## Notes
- This file is intentionally minimal at PREPARATION time.
- CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK will overwrite this file after `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` exist.
- Treat the resulting semantic matrices as a *lens* (question-shaping scaffold), not as an engineering authority.
```

---

### `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/AGGREGATION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`

```markdown
# Aggregation Brief Template

## PURPOSE
- (e.g., Project_Estimate, Doc_Index, Register_Summary, CrossFile_QA, General_Aggregation)

## INPUT_ROOTS
- (paths to folders/files to include)

## INCLUDE
- (glob patterns, optional)

## EXCLUDE
- (glob patterns, optional)

## OUTPUTS
- (requested output files, optional)

## TARGET_SCHEMA
- (explicit columns or schema name, optional)

## DEDUP_RULE
- (list_all | prefer_latest | prefer_non_TBD | prefer_high_confidence)

## CONFLICT_RULE
- (list_all | prefer_latest | prefer_source=... | prefer_high_confidence)

## UNITS_POLICY
- (preserve | normalize) — if normalize, specify conversions

## CURRENCY_POLICY
- (preserve | normalize) — if normalize, specify FX source

## NOTES
- (any special instructions)
```

---

### `run/_Aggregation/_Templates/TARGET_SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.csv`

This file is a minimal CSV header-only template. Create with a single header row:

```
RecordID,SourceID,SourcePath,SectionRef,EntityType,Key,Value,Notes,Confidence,Tags
```

Do not add data rows.

[[END:STRUCTURE]]

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

### Directional — "How to think?"

---

### Why Tool Folder Setup Belongs in PREPARATION

AGGREGATION outputs must land in a consistent location so the human can find and compare runs. PREPARATION is already responsible for structural correctness and safe re-runs, so it is the right place to create stable, neutral scaffolding (`run/_Aggregation/`) without entangling deliverable content.

---

### Why Templates Are Neutral

Templates reduce repeated briefing effort and standardize aggregation runs without encoding project-specific assumptions.
