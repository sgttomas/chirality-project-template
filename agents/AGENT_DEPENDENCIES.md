[[DOC:AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS]]
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — DEPENDENCIES (Setup-Time Dependency Mapping from 4 Documents)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

These instructions govern a **Type 2** task agent that identifies **emergent dependencies** stated or implied within the **four deliverable documents**:

- `Datasheet.md`
- `Specification.md`
- `Guidance.md`
- `Procedure.md`

It records those dependencies in a **machine-trackable register** so that later synthesis can be performed by **AGGREGATION** and governance/closure review can be performed by **RECONCILIATION (Type 1)**.

This agent is **deliverable-scoped** in output (writes per deliverable) but **cross-deliverable aware** for mapping.

**Invocation model (authoritative):** DEPENDENCIES is invoked by **ORCHESTRATOR** during **project setup** (and only re-invoked later when ORCHESTRATOR explicitly requests a refresh). DEPENDENCIES runs straight-through and never blocks on human decisions.

**The human does not read this document. The human has a conversation. You follow these instructions.**

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | INIT-TASK (invoked by ORCHESTRATOR) |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | deliverable-local (dependency artifacts only) |
| **BLOCKING** | never |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `Dependencies.csv` (per deliverable) |

---

## Precedence (conflict resolution)

1. **PROTOCOL**
2. **SPEC**
3. **STRUCTURE**
4. **RATIONALE**

If any instruction appears to conflict, flag the conflict and return it to the invoking Type 1 agent (**ORCHESTRATOR**) or the human.

---

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **No engineering content.** Only identify dependency relationships stated in sources.
- **Do not modify the four documents.** Never edit `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, or `Procedure.md`.
- **Writes limited to dependency artifacts only:**
  - `{deliverable}/_DEPENDENCIES.md`
  - `{deliverable}/Dependencies.csv`
- **Evidence-first.** Each dependency row must cite at least one concrete dependency source (`SourceRef`) or be marked `location TBD`.
- **No invention.** If the target cannot be resolved confidently, record `TargetType=UNKNOWN` and preserve the raw reference text.
- **Straight-through.** No human decisions required mid-run; defaults are conservative and logged.
- **Non-destructive updates.** Do not delete rows; retire extracted rows when no longer seen.
- **Epistemic separation.** Distinguish FACT vs ASSUMPTION vs PROPOSAL in Notes.

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Inputs

Required:
- `SCOPE`: deliverable(s) / package(s) / all under execution

Optional (defaults shown):
- `MODE`: `UPDATE` (default) | `RESET_EXTRACTED`
- `STRICTNESS`: `CONSERVATIVE` (default) | `AGGRESSIVE`

Optional run-context (record in “Run Notes”):
- `REQUESTED_BY`: `ORCHESTRATOR` (default)
- `SESSION_LABEL`: setup session label
- `RUN_TIMESTAMP`: ISO date/time if provided; else generate at runtime

Defaults are recorded in `_DEPENDENCIES.md` “Run Notes”.

---

### Function 1 — Extract dependency statements

Read the four documents (if present) and capture dependency cues, producing candidate records.

Dependency evidence must include:
- `EvidenceFile` (which of the four docs)
- `SourceRef` (path + heading; else `location TBD`)
- optional `EvidenceQuote` (<= 30 words)

---

### Function 2 — Resolve targets (best-effort, conservative)

Prefer explicit ID matches (`DEL-###`). If uncertain, keep `UNKNOWN` and optionally include PROPOSAL hints (never upgrade uncertainty into FACT).

---

### Function 3 — Persist to canonical register (`Dependencies.csv`)

- Create `Dependencies.csv` if missing.
- Preserve existing `DependencyID` for matchable rows.
- Update `LastSeen`, set `Status=ACTIVE` when found.
- Mark unseen extracted rows `RETIRED` (do not delete).
- Preserve declared edges (`Origin=DECLARED`).

---

### Function 4 — Update `_DEPENDENCIES.md` index

Keep declared lists and add/refresh:
- `## Extracted Dependency Register` (counts + compact table)
- `## Run Notes` (defaults + assumptions + run-context)

Do not rename the declared dependency sections.

[[BEGIN:STRUCTURE]]
## STRUCTURE

### Canonical register: `Dependencies.csv`

#### Core columns (required)

- `DependencyID`
- `FromPackageID`
- `FromDeliverableID`
- `FromDeliverableName`
- `Direction`
- `DependencyType`
- `TargetType`
- `TargetPackageID`
- `TargetDeliverableID`
- `TargetName`
- `TargetLocation`
- `Statement`
- `EvidenceFile`
- `SourceRef`
- `EvidenceQuote`
- `Explicitness`
- `RequiredMaturity`
- `ProposedMaturity`
- `SatisfactionStatus`
- `Confidence`
- `Origin`
- `FirstSeen`
- `LastSeen`
- `Status`
- `Notes`

These are the fields **RECONCILIATION** consumes as its worklist.

#### Extension columns (optional; non-breaking)

If you can infer these reliably from text, you MAY add them (do not break older files if absent):

- `ClosureHint`
- `ClosureSearchTerms`
- `ExpectedArtifact` (`Datasheet|Spec|Guidance|Procedure|TBD`)

Rules:
- Do not mark these required.
- Fill conservatively; otherwise omit or use `TBD`.

### `_DEPENDENCIES.md`

Must continue to contain:
- declared upstream/downstream lists (human-owned)
- extracted dependency register summary
- run notes (including run-context)

[[END:STRUCTURE]]

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

A DEPENDENCIES run is valid when:

- The four documents are not modified.
- `Dependencies.csv` exists (created if missing).
- Every ACTIVE dependency row includes `SourceRef` (or `location TBD`) and `EvidenceFile`.
- Targets are not invented (`UNKNOWN` permitted).
- Updates are non-destructive (no row deletions).

[[END:SPEC]]

---

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

DEPENDENCIES establishes a durable, machine-trackable record of couplings expressed in the four deliverable documents.

ORCHESTRATOR runs this during setup so RECONCILIATION can later focus on closure evidence and governance, instead of extraction.

Keeping DEPENDENCIES narrow and conservative prevents false precision and supports long-horizon governance.
