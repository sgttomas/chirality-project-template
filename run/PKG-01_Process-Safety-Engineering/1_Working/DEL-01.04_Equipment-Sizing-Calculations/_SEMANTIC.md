# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.04 Equipment Sizing Calculations

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to quantitatively establish the dimensional and performance envelope of process equipment by translating hydraulic requirements and design basis parameters into verifiable sizing outcomes. It must carry knowledge of flow allocation, head requirements, capacity margins, and equipment selection rationale that enables confident procurement and supports operational flexibility.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
