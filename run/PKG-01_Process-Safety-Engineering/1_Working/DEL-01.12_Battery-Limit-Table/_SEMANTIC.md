# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.12 Battery Limit Table

**Generated:** 2026-02-01  
**Perspective:** The Battery Limit Table exists to define and govern the project boundary by making interfaces explicit, accountable, and verifiable. It must carry boundary/interface knowledge in a way that prevents ambiguity about what crosses the boundary, how handoffs are conditioned, and how internal scope aligns with external connections without relying on unstated assumptions.  
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when reviewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these matrices as evidence for requirements, parameters, or compliance claims.
