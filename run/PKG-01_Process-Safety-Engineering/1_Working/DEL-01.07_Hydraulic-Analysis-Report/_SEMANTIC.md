# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.07 Hydraulic Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Hydraulic Analysis Report exists to characterize and validate the steady-state flow behavior, pressure distribution, and pump performance of interconnected liquid handling systems—providing the quantified basis for confirming that equipment sizing, pipe dimensioning, and system configurations achieve required throughput while maintaining adequate operating margins across all anticipated conditions.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For the Hydraulic Analysis Report, the lenses especially illuminate:
  - **Flow and pressure characterization** through the operative row lenses
  - **NPSH verification and pump performance** through performance assessment and validation lenses
  - **Regulatory and standard compliance** through normative row lenses
  - **Model coordination and quality assurance** through evaluative row lenses
