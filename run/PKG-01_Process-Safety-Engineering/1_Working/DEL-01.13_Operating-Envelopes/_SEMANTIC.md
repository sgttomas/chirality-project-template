# Deliverble: DEL-01.13 Operating Envelopes

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable defines operating envelopes that bound allowable operating conditions and constraints across operating modes. It functions as a control reference for safe and consistent operation while supporting design verification and operational readiness. It expresses categories and relationships for limits and constraints without prescribing project-specific numeric setpoints or equipment tags.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
