# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.06 Pressure Relief / Thermal Relief Calculations

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides the analytical basis for overpressure protection across process equipment and piping systems. It establishes relief device necessity through scenario identification, sizes devices per governing codes, and verifies installation adequacy to ensure equipment operates within design limits under all credible upset conditions.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
