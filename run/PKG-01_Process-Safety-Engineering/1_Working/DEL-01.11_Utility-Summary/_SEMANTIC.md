# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.11 Utility Summary

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable consolidates utility demands across all service types (electrical, air, water, fuel) to establish the complete resource consumption profile for facilities under design. The Utility Summary must synthesize discipline-specific technical data into a unified tabular view that enables infrastructure planning, procurement coordination, and operational readiness verification.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
