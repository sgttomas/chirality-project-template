# Deliverble: DEL-01.14 Specification Deviations (Process)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** A deliverable-local semantic lens for structuring how departures from standards are described, justified, reviewed, approved, and maintained as an auditable record for process engineering—without embedding project-specific particulars.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Matrix A — Orientation (3×4)
| | **guiding** | **applying** | **judging** | **reviewing** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | policy intent | enforceable expectation | decision criterion | governance oversight |
| **operative** | work framing | controlled execution | acceptance control | continuous stewardship |
| **evaluative** | value frame | impact appraisal | defensibility test | lessons synthesis |

## Matrix B — Conceptualization (4×4)
| | **necessity** | **sufficiency** | **completeness** | **consistency** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **data** | required records | adequate recordset | full record coverage | coherent records |
| **information** | essential documentation | adequate documentation | complete documentation | aligned documentation |
| **knowledge** | critical understanding | workable understanding | comprehensive understanding | shared understanding |
| **wisdom** | prudent judgment | sound judgment | holistic judgment | steady judgment |

## Matrix C — Formulation (3×4)
| | **necessity** | **sufficiency** | **completeness** | **consistency** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | nonnegotiable control intent | defensible approval discipline | lifecycle-spanning governance frame | contradiction-resistant governance frame |
| **operative** | minimum viable tracking practice | workable submission-and-review flow | end-to-end handling structure | stable upkeep structure |
| **evaluative** | minimum decision basis | defensible acceptance basis | risk-and-traceability basis | coherent acceptance basis |

## Matrix F — Requirements (3×4)
| | **necessity** | **sufficiency** | **completeness** | **consistency** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | approval-accountable governance rules | governance rules that enable timely resolution | governance rules that cover initiation-to-closeout | governance rules that prevent conflicting outcomes |
| **operative** | required register fields and workflow steps | register fields and steps enabling workable submissions | register fields and steps covering all states | register fields and steps uniform across updates |
| **evaluative** | required justification and risk evidence | evidence enabling defensible acceptance | evidence covering implications and traceability | evidence coherent across reviews |

## Matrix D — Objectives (3×4)
| | **guiding** | **applying** | **judging** | **reviewing** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | obligations that anchor deviation intent | obligations translated into controlled practice | controlled practice translated into approval outcomes | approval outcomes folded into oversight learning |
| **operative** | planned submissions that anchor deviation work | submissions translated into maintained tracking | maintained tracking translated into controlled decisions | controlled decisions folded into continuous upkeep |
| **evaluative** | decision basis that anchors deviation value | decision basis translated into impact appraisal | impact appraisal translated into acceptance rationale | acceptance rationale folded into audit learning |

## Matrix K — Transpose of D (4×3)
| | **normative** | **operative** | **evaluative** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **guiding** | obligations that anchor deviation intent | planned submissions that anchor deviation work | decision basis that anchors deviation value |
| **applying** | obligations translated into controlled practice | submissions translated into maintained tracking | decision basis translated into impact appraisal |
| **judging** | controlled practice translated into approval outcomes | maintained tracking translated into controlled decisions | impact appraisal translated into acceptance rationale |
| **reviewing** | approval outcomes folded into oversight learning | controlled decisions folded into continuous upkeep | acceptance rationale folded into audit learning |

## Matrix X — Verification (4×4)
| | **necessity** | **sufficiency** | **completeness** | **consistency** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **guiding** | confirmation that intent is captured as obligations | confirmation that obligations enable workable resolution | confirmation that obligations span the deviation space | confirmation that obligations do not conflict |
| **applying** | confirmation that practice enforces obligations | confirmation that practice supports timely submissions | confirmation that practice covers all fields and states | confirmation that practice stays uniform over time |
| **judging** | confirmation that decisions follow stated criteria | confirmation that evidence supports acceptance | confirmation that evidence spans implications and traceability | confirmation that decisions remain coherent |
| **reviewing** | confirmation that oversight retains decision trail | confirmation that upkeep maintains currency | confirmation that audits can trace initiation to closeout | confirmation that lessons do not contradict history |

## Matrix E — Evaluation (3×4)
| | **necessity** | **sufficiency** | **completeness** | **consistency** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | minimum governance appraisal | governance appraisal adequate for disciplined approvals | governance appraisal that spans lifecycle and auditability | governance appraisal that preserves non-contradictory outcomes |
| **operative** | minimum workflow appraisal | workflow appraisal adequate for maintainable tracking | workflow appraisal that spans end-to-end handling | workflow appraisal that preserves uniform operation |
| **evaluative** | minimum decision appraisal | decision appraisal adequate for defensible acceptance | decision appraisal that spans implications and traceability | decision appraisal that preserves coherent history |
