---

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Required Inputs

| Input | Source | Status Required |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| TM Engineering Standards | TM Document Control | Available |
| Process Design Basis | DEL-01.01 | Approved or IFR |
| Deviation Register Template | Project Quality / TM | Approved template |
| TM Approval Process Documentation | TM Project Procedures | Available |

### 2.2 Required Resources

- Process engineers familiar with PSO scope and TM standards
- Access to TM engineering standards library
- Deviation register template (per TM requirements) - **TBD**
- Communication channel to TM Engineering for approval submissions

### 2.3 Required Approvals

- None required to initiate deviation identification
- TM approval required before implementing any deviation

---

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Identify Potential Deviation
**Responsible:** Process Engineer

1.1. During design development, compare design approach against TM standards

1.2. Identify any instance where proposed design differs from TM requirements

1.3. Confirm deviation is necessary (i.e., standard compliance is not feasible or practical)

1.4. Document deviation in working notes for further evaluation

**Output:** List of potential deviations requiring evaluation

---

### Step 2: Evaluate and Justify Deviation
**Responsible:** Process Engineer / Lead Process Engineer

2.1. Review specific TM standard clause being deviated from

2.2. Document the requirement and the proposed alternative approach

2.3. Develop technical justification:
   - Engineering basis for deviation
   - Performance comparison (if applicable)
   - Safety assessment

2.4. Develop commercial justification (if applicable):
   - Cost impact
   - Schedule impact
   - Lifecycle considerations

2.5. Prepare risk assessment:
   - Safety impact (Low/Medium/High)
   - Reliability impact (Low/Medium/High)
   - Cost impact (Low/Medium/High)
   - Schedule impact (Low/Medium/High)
   - Identify any mitigation measures

2.6. Identify all affected design documents

**Output:** Complete deviation justification package

---

### Step 3: Internal Review
**Responsible:** Lead Process Engineer / Engineering Manager

3.1. Review deviation justification for completeness

3.2. Verify technical justification is sound

3.3. Confirm risk assessment is appropriate

3.4. Validate that deviation is necessary

3.5. Approve for submission to TM

**Output:** Approved deviation package for TM submission

---

### Step 4: Submit to TM for Approval
**Responsible:** Process Engineer / Project Engineer

4.1. Assign unique deviation ID per project convention (format: SD-PR-###)

4.2. Enter deviation into register with status "Submitted"

4.3. Prepare submission package per TM requirements:
   - Deviation request form (if TM template exists)
   - Justification documentation
   - Supporting drawings/calculations

4.4. Submit to TM Engineering through established project channels

4.5. Record submission date and TM contact

4.6. Note expected approval timeline based on deviation significance:
   - Minor deviations: ~2 weeks
   - Significant deviations: ~4 weeks
   - Major deviations: ~6+ weeks

**Output:** Deviation submitted to TM, register updated

---

### Step 5: Support TM Review
**Responsible:** Process Engineer

5.1. Monitor TM review progress

5.2. Respond to TM queries and requests for clarification

5.3. Provide additional information as required

5.4. Participate in review meetings if requested

5.5. Update register with review status as information becomes available

**Output:** TM queries addressed, review supported

---

### Step 6: Receive and Process TM Decision
**Responsible:** Process Engineer / Lead Process Engineer

6.1. Receive TM approval decision (Approved / Approved with Conditions / Rejected)

6.2. If **Approved**:
   - Record approval reference number and date
   - Document any conditions attached to approval
   - Update register status to "Approved"
   - Proceed to Step 7

6.3. If **Approved with Conditions**:
   - Document conditions in register
   - Assess ability to comply with conditions
   - If acceptable, update status to "Approved with Conditions"
   - Proceed to Step 7

6.4. If **Rejected**:
   - Document rejection reason in register
   - Update status to "Rejected"
   - Revise design to comply with TM standard
   - OR prepare revised deviation request addressing TM concerns

**Output:** Register updated with TM decision

---

### Step 7: Implement Approved Deviation
**Responsible:** Process Engineer

7.1. Incorporate approved deviation into design documents:
   - Update P&IDs
   - Update equipment datasheets
   - Update calculations
   - Update specifications

7.2. Ensure all conditions are addressed in implementation

7.3. Reference deviation approval in affected documents (remarks, notes)

7.4. Update register to note implementation status

**Output:** Deviation implemented in design documents

---

### Step 8: Closeout
**Responsible:** Lead Process Engineer

8.1. Verify deviation properly implemented in all affected documents

8.2. Confirm conditions (if any) have been satisfied

8.3. Update register status to "Closed"

8.4. File supporting documentation

**Output:** Deviation closed in register
