# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.03 Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams serve as the authoritative schematic representation of process systems, capturing the complete interrelationship of equipment, piping, instrumentation, and control elements. The P&ID deliverable must integrate design basis parameters, transform vendor information into project standards, and provide the foundational reference for downstream lists, HAZOP studies, and construction documentation.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the P&ID deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The P&ID semantic lens emphasizes: regulatory compliance (ISA 5.1, TM standards), operational completeness (equipment, piping, instrumentation coverage), quality assurance (symbol consistency, tag traceability), and integration requirements (vendor transformation, HAZOP incorporation).
