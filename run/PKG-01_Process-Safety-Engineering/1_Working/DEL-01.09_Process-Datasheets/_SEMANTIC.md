# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.09 Process Datasheets

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Process Datasheets provide the structured interface between process engineering knowledge and equipment-specific technical disciplines. This deliverable must carry the authoritative process conditions, operating parameters, and fluid properties that enable mechanical and instrumentation specialists to specify, procure, and verify equipment performance across the full operational envelope. The datasheets serve as traceable bridges from calculation-based design basis to equipment-specific requirements.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For Process Datasheets specifically, consider how each lens applies to: equipment identification, process conditions, fluid properties, operating ranges, design envelopes, and interdisciplinary data interfaces.
