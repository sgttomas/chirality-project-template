# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.02 Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) exist to establish and communicate the schematic representation of process systems at a level of abstraction that enables design coordination, safety analysis, and operational understanding. They must carry knowledge about major equipment relationships, material and energy flows, operating conditions, and system boundaries while maintaining traceability to design basis parameters and supporting downstream detailed engineering development.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
