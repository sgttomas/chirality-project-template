# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.08 Transient Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable captures the knowledge of transient hydraulic behavior, evaluating time-dependent pressure phenomena (surge, waterhammer, column separation) arising from operational events to ensure system integrity remains within design limits and to identify protective measures when required.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the Transient Analysis Report deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For this transient analysis context, key semantic intersections include:
  - **Normative-Necessity** lenses address mandatory compliance foundations for surge/waterhammer standards
  - **Operative-Completeness** lenses address total functional coverage of transient scenarios
  - **Evaluative-Consistency** lenses address unified merit standards for analysis quality
