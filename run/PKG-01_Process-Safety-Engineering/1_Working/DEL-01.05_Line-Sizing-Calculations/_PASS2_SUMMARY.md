## Cross-Reference Consistency Check Results

### Issues Identified and Resolved

#### 1. SOW Reference Format Standardization
**Issue:** Inconsistent SOW citation formats across documents
- Some used narrative format (e.g., "per SOW §3.1.3.1")
- Others used task IDs (e.g., "SOW-0114")

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to use SOW task IDs for traceability: SOW-0114, SOW-0130, SOW-0231
- Retained section references where they add clarity (e.g., "SOW §2.3.1.1")
- Applied consistently across all four documents

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Procedure, Guidance, Datasheet

---

#### 2. Manifold Configuration Clarification
**Issue:** "5x6 manifold" was ambiguous - could be interpreted different ways

**Resolution:**
- Clarified as "5x6 (5 inlet headers, 6 outlet headers)" throughout
- Updated all references in:
  - Specification FR-03, CAL-05, AC-06
  - Procedure Phase 3 steps 3.2 and 3.3
  - Guidance PSO-Specific Considerations, Manifold Configuration section
  - Datasheet Line Categories and Technical Attributes

**Documents Updated:** All four documents

---

#### 3. Native File Requirements Reference
**Issue:** Inconsistent citation of native file submission requirements
- Some cited "SOW §3.2.3.18, §3.2.3.31"
- Others just cited one section

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to "SOW-0231" (the specific task for native files)
- Updated in Specification DR-01, Procedure records section, Datasheet attributes

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Procedure, Datasheet

---

#### 4. Velocity Criteria Assumption Format
**Issue:** Velocity assumptions stated slightly differently across documents
- Some said "1-2 m/s", others "1.0-2.0 m/s"
- Inconsistent precision

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to "1.0-2.0 m/s suction, 3.0-5.0 m/s discharge"
- Applied uniform format across all velocity criteria tables
- Maintained clarity that these are assumptions pending TMP Standards

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Guidance, Datasheet

---

#### 5. TMP Standards Reference
**Issue:** Inconsistent reference to TMP Standards document
- Sometimes "Attachment A08"
- Sometimes just "TMP Standards"

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to "TMP Standards (Attachment A08)"
- Clarifies both the content and the document location
- Applied across all references

**Documents Updated:** All four documents

---

#### 6. Hydraulic Optimization SOW Reference
**Issue:** Different formats for hydraulic optimization requirement
- "SOW §3.1.3.2" vs "per SOW §3.1.3.2"

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to "SOW-0130" for task-based reference
- More traceable to specific scope of work item
- Updated in Specification FR-02, Procedure scope, Guidance principles

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Procedure, Guidance

---

#### 7. Document Control References
**Issue:** References to document control procedures were inconsistent
- Some referenced "PKG-00"
- Others didn't specify deliverable IDs

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to specific deliverable IDs:
  - DEL-00.01 (Master Document Register)
  - DEL-00.04 (Change Control)
- Updated in Specification DR-04 and Procedure related procedures section

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Procedure

---

#### 8. Related Deliverable Cross-References
**Issue:** DEL-IDs mentioned throughout needed consistency check

**Resolution:**
- Verified all DEL-ID references are consistent:
  - DEL-01.01 (Design Basis Memorandum)
  - DEL-01.02 (PFDs)
  - DEL-01.03 (P&IDs)
  - DEL-01.04 (Equipment Sizing)
  - DEL-01.07 (Hydraulic Analysis)
  - DEL-02.01 (Line List)
  - DEL-00.01 (MDR)
- All references now uniform across documents

**Documents Updated:** All four documents

---

#### 9. Pressure Drop Budget Source
**Issue:** dP budget source inconsistently referenced
- Sometimes "hydraulic optimization"
- Sometimes "DEL-01.07"

**Resolution:**
- Standardized to "Per hydraulic optimization (DEL-01.07)"
- Clarifies both the activity and the deliverable source
- Updated in Specification design criteria, Guidance considerations

**Documents Updated:** Specification, Guidance, Datasheet

---

## Verification Performed

### Cross-Document Consistency Checks

- ✅ All SOW references use consistent format (task IDs + section numbers where helpful)
- ✅ All DEL-ID references are consistent and correct
- ✅ Manifold configuration clearly defined as "5x6 (5 inlet, 6 outlet)"
- ✅ Velocity assumptions uniformly stated with proper precision
- ✅ TMP Standards consistently referenced with Attachment ID
- ✅ Native file requirements consistently cite SOW-0231
- ✅ Related deliverable references are consistent
- ✅ Technical parameters aligned across all documents

### Internal Consistency Checks

- ✅ Specification requirements match Procedure steps
- ✅ Guidance recommendations align with Specification criteria
- ✅ Datasheet attributes match Specification/Procedure parameters
- ✅ All TBDs consistently flagged across documents
- ✅ Assumptions uniformly documented
