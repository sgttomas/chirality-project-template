# Semantic Lens: DEL-01.05 Line Sizing Calculations

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Line Sizing Calculations serve to establish the hydraulic adequacy of process piping by determining appropriate pipe diameters that satisfy velocity constraints, pressure drop budgets, and NPSH requirements while enabling coordinated optimization across the pump station, manifold, and pipeline system.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
