   - I&C requirements (instrumentation interface per PKG-07)
   - Piping requirements (connection details per PKG-02)

4.4. Document review comments

4.5. Resolve comments with originator

**Output:** Reviewed MR package, comments resolved

---

### Step 5: TM Technical Review
**Responsible:** Process Engineer / TM Engineering

5.1. Submit MR package to TM Engineering for review

5.2. Provide additional information as requested

5.3. Address TM technical comments

5.4. Obtain TM technical approval
