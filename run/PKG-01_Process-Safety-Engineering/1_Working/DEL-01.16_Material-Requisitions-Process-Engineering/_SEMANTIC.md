# Deliverble: DEL-01.16 Material Requisitions (Process) (Engineering)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable conditions process-engineering procurement intent into material requisition packages that communicate performance, materials, interfaces, and verification expectations clearly enough for vendors and reviewers to bid, evaluate, and procure equipment without hidden assumptions. It exists to support procurement decisions and downstream quality/acceptance without substituting for engineering authority.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
