# Procedure: DEL-01.10 Valve Numbering Diagrams

**Document ID:** DEL-01.10-PR
**Revision:** Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Consistency Check)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** DRAFT - Pass 2

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Procedure Intent

This procedure defines the step-by-step process for developing, reviewing, and finalizing Valve Numbering Diagrams for the Puget Sound Optimization (PSO) project. Following this procedure ensures all valves are systematically identified, uniquely numbered per TM convention, and documented in clear schematic diagrams maintained through IFC.

### 1.2 Applicability

This procedure applies to:
- FEED phase preliminary valve numbering diagrams
- Detailed design phase updates (per SOW-0222 and SOW-0232)
- Incorporation of HAZOP findings, model review changes, and vendor data
- Maintenance through IFC
