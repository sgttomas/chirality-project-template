# Deliverble: DEL-01.15 HAZOP Final Report & Closeout Items

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable conditions a process-safety record of a HAZOP study into an auditable report plus a closeout mechanism for recommendations, such that hazards, risk rankings, responses, and closure evidence remain legible across review cycles. It exists to support disciplined decision review and action closure governance for PSO scope changes without substituting for engineering authority.
