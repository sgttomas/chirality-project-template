**Revision:** Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Consistency Check)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** DRAFT - Pass 2

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines the requirements for the HAZOP Final Report and Closeout Items deliverable for the Puget Sound Optimization (PSO) project. The HAZOP study is a systematic technique to identify potential hazards and operability problems in the PSO facility modifications.

### 1.2 Boundaries

- **In Scope:**
  - All new PSO equipment and piping systems
  - Modifications to existing systems within PSO scope
  - Tie-in points to existing TM facilities
  - Control and safety systems for PSO scope
  - Containment and environmental protection systems

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Existing TM facilities beyond immediate tie-in points
  - Systems not affected by PSO modifications
  - Construction HAZOP (if separate)

### 1.3 Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| TM Operations | Provide operational experience and participate in study |
| TM Safety | Provide TM-approved risk matrix, safety requirements, participate in study |
| TM Engineering | Technical review and approval |
| Design Disciplines | Respond to HAZOP recommendations in design |
| Construction | Receive HAZOP requirements affecting installation |
