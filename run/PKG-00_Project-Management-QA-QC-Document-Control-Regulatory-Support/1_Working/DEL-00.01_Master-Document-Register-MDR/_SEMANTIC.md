# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.01 Master Document Register (MDR)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Master Document Register (MDR) exists to maintain authoritative visibility over all project documentation artifacts, ensuring completeness, traceability, and currency of document status throughout the engineering lifecycle. It serves as the single source of truth for document inventory, enabling stakeholder verification, audit support, and systematic document control compliance.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
