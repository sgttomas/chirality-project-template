# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.18 Supplemental Final Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Supplemental Final Report exists to capture and consolidate post-design engineering support activities—field engineering, design changes, commissioning support, startup assistance, and lessons learned—that occur after the initial Final Report, providing a complete closure narrative for engineering involvement and enabling traceability from design intent through constructed reality.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
