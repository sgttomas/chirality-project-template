# Guidance: DEL-00.18 Supplemental Final Report

**Document ID:** DEL-00.18-GD
**Revision:** Pass 1 (Initial Draft)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Draft - Pending Review

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent

This guidance document provides practical direction for preparing the Supplemental Final Report for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). It supplements the formal Specification by offering context, best practices, and recommendations for effective report development.

### 1.2 Audience

- Project Manager
- Field Engineering Lead
- Commissioning Lead
- Discipline leads with construction/commissioning involvement
- Document Control personnel

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Continuity** | Report continues the narrative from Final Report through construction/startup |
| **Completeness** | All support activities documented; nothing falls through the cracks |
| **Traceability** | Changes and resolutions traceable to original design |
| **Lessons Captured** | Project learnings documented for future benefit |
| **Handoff Ready** | Information sufficient to support ongoing operations |

### 2.2 Guiding Philosophy

The Supplemental Final Report closes the loop on engineering involvement in the project. It documents:
- How the design was supported through construction
- What changes were made and why
- How issues were resolved
- What was learned that could benefit future projects
- The final state of as-built documentation

---

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Relationship to Final Report

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Structural Alignment** | Use similar format to Final Report for consistency |
| **Content Boundary** | Avoid duplicating Final Report content; reference it instead |
| **Timeline Continuity** | Supplemental Report picks up where Final Report leaves off |

### 3.2 Data Collection During Construction

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Real-time Recording** | Encourage field engineering to maintain logs during construction, not after |
| **Change Tracking** | Ensure all changes are properly logged in Design Change Control Log |
| **Query Documentation** | Maintain RFI/field query log with resolutions documented |

### 3.3 Lessons Learned

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Capture Broadly** | Include lessons from all aspects: design, construction support, commissioning |
| **Be Constructive** | Focus on actionable recommendations, not blame |
| **Include Successes** | Document what worked well, not just problems |

---

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Timing

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **After Full Startup Complete** | Complete record; all activities covered | Delays issuance; details may be forgotten |
| **After Construction Complete** | Earlier delivery of most content | May need supplement for startup lessons |
| **Progressive Drafting** | Nothing forgotten; earlier internal review | Higher coordination effort |

**Recommendation:** Progressive drafting with final compilation after startup support complete. This balances completeness with timely capture.

### 4.2 Level of Detail

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Summary Level** | Concise; quick reference | May lose important details |
| **Detailed** | Complete record | Lengthy; may duplicate logs |
| **Balanced with Appendices** | Main report readable; details available | More complex document structure |

**Recommendation:** Summary in main report with detailed logs/records referenced or included as appendices.

### 4.3 Lessons Learned Approach

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Embedded in Sections** | Context preserved | May be overlooked |
| **Dedicated Section** | Easy to find; actionable | May lose context |
| **Both** | Best of both worlds | Potential redundancy |

**Recommendation:** Dedicated lessons learned section with cross-references to relevant report sections.

### 5.2 Sample Design Change Summary Format

| Change ID | Description | Reason | Impact | Approval Date | As-Built Updated |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|---------------|------------------|
| MOC-001 | Valve orientation revision | Field fit | Minor - no process impact | 2026-07-15 | Yes |
| MOC-002 | Cable routing modification | Interference avoidance | None | 2026-08-01 | Yes |

### 5.3 Sample Lessons Learned Format

| ID | Category | Lesson | Recommendation |
|----|----------|--------|----------------|
| LL-001 | Design | Pipe support locations should be coordinated with steel detailing earlier | Include support locations in 60% review |
| LL-002 | Construction Support | Daily site presence reduced query response time | Consider dedicated field engineer for similar projects |

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Missing Activities** | Maintain activity log during construction; review regularly |
| **Undocumented Changes** | Enforce change control discipline; no informal changes |
| **Forgotten Lessons** | Capture lessons as they occur; hold periodic lessons sessions |
| **Late Compilation** | Draft progressively; do not wait until project end |
| **Disconnect from Final Report** | Use same structure and cross-reference appropriately |
| **Missing As-Built Status** | Coordinate with document control for accurate status |

---

## 7. Notes and Assumptions

1. **ASSUMPTION:** Report outline shown is representative; actual outline subject to TM approval.
2. **ASSUMPTION:** Supplemental Final Report is standalone; references Final Report.
3. **TBD:** TM-specific report template or formatting requirements.
4. **TBD:** Specific timing/schedule requirements from SOW.
5. **ASSUMPTION:** Electronic delivery is primary; physical copies TBD.
