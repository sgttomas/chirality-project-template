# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.03 Deliverable Review & Verification Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to establish the systematic framework through which all engineering work products are examined for correctness, completeness, and compliance. It carries the knowledge of how review independence, verification rigor, and comment resolution processes ensure that delivered artifacts meet their intended purposes before external submission.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
