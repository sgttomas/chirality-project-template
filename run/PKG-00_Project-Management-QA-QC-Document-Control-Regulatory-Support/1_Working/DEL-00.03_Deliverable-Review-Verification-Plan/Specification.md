**Document ID:** DEL-00.03-SP
**Revision:** Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Check)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Draft - Pending Review

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines the requirements for the Deliverable Review & Verification Plan to be developed by the Engineering Contractor for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). The plan shall define the processes for reviewing and verifying all contractor deliverables to ensure quality, accuracy, and compliance with project requirements.

**Note:** Terminal Manager is abbreviated as "TM" throughout this document. Interdisciplinary Review is abbreviated as "IDR".

### 1.2 Applicability

This specification applies to:
- All documents produced by the Engineering Contractor
- All drawings across all disciplines
- All calculations and reports
- All engineering deliverables from FEED through Detailed Design

### 1.3 Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Internal review and checking processes
- Interdisciplinary review (IDR) processes
- Design verification methods (calculations, drawings, models, vendor data)
- Terminal Manager (TM) review coordination
- Comment tracking and resolution
- Review documentation and records

**Out of Scope:**
- TM internal review processes (reference only)
- Third-party reviews (e.g., regulatory) beyond coordination
