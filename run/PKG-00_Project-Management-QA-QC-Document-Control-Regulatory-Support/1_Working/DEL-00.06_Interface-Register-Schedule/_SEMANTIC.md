# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.06 Interface Register & Schedule

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Interface Register & Schedule exists to systematically capture, track, and coordinate all technical, organizational, and schedule dependencies between parties, disciplines, and external entities throughout project execution. It must carry knowledge of interface identification, ownership assignment, due-date alignment, status progression, and resolution documentation to enable proactive coordination and prevent downstream integration failures.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
