**Document ID:** DEL-00.11-GD
**Revision:** Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Check)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Draft - Pending Review

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent

This guidance document provides practical direction for developing and submitting Completion Management Reports (CMRs) for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). It supplements the formal Specification by offering context, best practices, and recommendations for effective implementation.

### 1.2 Audience

- Project Controls personnel
- Site managers and supervisors
- Engineering leads
- Quality assurance personnel
- Construction management team

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Completeness** | CMR must address all required completion criteria without gaps |
| **Accuracy** | Information must reflect actual site readiness status |
| **Timeliness** | CMR must be submitted with adequate lead time for TM review |
| **Accountability** | Clear ownership for outstanding items and sign-offs |
| **Traceability** | Supporting documentation must be referenced and available |

### 2.2 Guiding Philosophy

The CMR serves as the formal gate document confirming that a work site is ready for field activities. It protects both the contractor and TM by ensuring:
- All pre-work requirements are satisfied
- Outstanding issues are identified and managed
- Appropriate approvals are obtained
- A clear record exists of site readiness status

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Initial Setup Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Template Acquisition** | Request CMR template from TM early in project. If not provided, propose a format based on industry standards for TM approval. |
| **Completion Criteria** | Confirm with TM the specific criteria that must be addressed in the CMR. These may include safety, environmental, permitting, and technical readiness items. |
| **Site Definition** | Clearly define what constitutes a "site" for CMR purposes. For PSO, the primary site is Sumas Tank Farm; confirm with TM if sub-areas require separate CMRs. |

### 3.2 Development Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Data Collection** | Establish a process for collecting completion status information from all contributing disciplines. |
| **Outstanding Item Tracking** | Maintain a live tracker for outstanding items; transfer to CMR when ready for submission. |
| **Lead Time** | Plan for adequate review time. **ASSUMPTION:** Allow minimum 2 weeks for TM review and approval cycle. |

### 3.3 Integration Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **JHA Coordination** | CMR and JHA (DEL-00.12) are companion documents. Coordinate development to ensure consistency. |
| **Systems Completion Plan** | CMR should align with the overall approach defined in the Systems Completion Plan (DEL-00.13). |
| **Document Control** | Register CMR in MDR (DEL-00.01) and ensure proper transmittal tracking. |

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Level of Detail

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **High Detail** (extensive narrative) | Comprehensive record; addresses potential questions | Time-consuming; may delay approval |
| **Checklist-Based** (structured format) | Efficient; clear pass/fail criteria | May miss nuanced issues |

**Recommendation:** Use a structured checklist format with provision for narrative comments where needed. This balances efficiency with completeness.

### 4.2 Outstanding Item Threshold

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Zero Outstanding Items** (all items closed) | Maximum readiness; no residual risk | May delay mobilization |
| **Conditional Approval** (minor items deferred) | Enables schedule progress | Requires close tracking; potential for issues |

**Recommendation:** Target zero critical outstanding items; minor items may be conditionally accepted with TM agreement and a defined closure plan.

### 4.3 Site Granularity

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **One CMR per Major Site** | Simpler administration | May miss sub-area specifics |
| **CMR per Work Area** | Granular control | Higher administrative burden |

**Recommendation:** Confirm with TM. **ASSUMPTION:** One CMR per major work site (e.g., Sumas Tank Farm as a single site) unless TM directs otherwise.

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Sample CMR Section Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Report Information | CMR number, date, revision, site identification |
| 2. Scope Summary | Description of work to be performed at site |
| 3. Completion Status | Table of completion criteria with status (Complete/Incomplete/N/A) |
| 4. Outstanding Items | Table of open items with owner, action, and target date |
| 5. Supporting Documentation | List of referenced documents (permits, JHA, etc.) |
| 6. Sign-off | Signature blocks for required approvers |
| 7. Appendices | Detailed supporting information as needed |

### 5.2 Sample Completion Criteria (**ASSUMPTION**)

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Design Complete | IFC drawings issued for site work scope |
| Permits Obtained | All required permits in place |
| Materials Available | Key materials on-site or delivery confirmed |
| Safety Documentation | JHA complete and approved |
| Environmental Controls | Erosion/sediment controls in place |
| Access Confirmed | Site access arrangements finalized |
| Utilities Identified | Existing utilities located and marked |

### 5.3 Sample Outstanding Item Entry

| Item # | Description | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| OI-001 | Confirm delivery date for large pump | Procurement | 2026-03-15 | Open |
| OI-002 | Finalize temporary power connection | Electrical Lead | 2026-03-10 | Open |

## 6. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Late Submission** | Plan CMR development in advance; track lead time requirements |
| **Incomplete Criteria** | Use a standard checklist; verify all required items are addressed |
| **Unassigned Outstanding Items** | Require owner and target date for every outstanding item |
| **Missing Sign-offs** | Identify required approvers early; build time into schedule |
| **Inconsistency with JHA** | Cross-check CMR and JHA for the same site |
| **Outdated Information** | Update CMR immediately before submission to reflect current status |

---

## 7. Notes and Assumptions

1. **ASSUMPTION:** CMR template to be provided by TM; if not, contractor to propose format.
2. **ASSUMPTION:** Primary site for PSO is Sumas Tank Farm; confirm if sub-areas require separate CMRs.
3. **TBD:** Specific completion criteria to be confirmed with TM.
4. **TBD:** Required signatories for CMR approval.
5. **ASSUMPTION:** Minimum 2-week lead time for TM review cycle.
