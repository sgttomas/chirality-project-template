# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.11 Completion Management Report (CMR)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Completion Management Report (CMR) serves as the formal gate document confirming site readiness prior to field work commencement. This deliverable carries knowledge regarding completion status verification, outstanding item identification, approval tracking, and the establishment of documented authorization for proceeding with site-specific activities.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
