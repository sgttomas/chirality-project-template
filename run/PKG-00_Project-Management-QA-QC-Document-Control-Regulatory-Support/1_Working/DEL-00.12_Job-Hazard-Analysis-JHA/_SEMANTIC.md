# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.12 Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to formalize the systematic identification of workplace hazards and their mitigations for each work activity at each site. It must carry knowledge sufficient to enable hazard recognition, risk assessment, control implementation, and worker communication - creating a documented safety bridge between work planning and safe execution.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
