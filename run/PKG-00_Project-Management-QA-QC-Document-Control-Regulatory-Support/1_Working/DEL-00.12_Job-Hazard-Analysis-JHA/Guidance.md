**Document ID:** DEL-00.12-GD
**Revision:** Pass 2 (Cross-Reference Check)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Draft - Pending Review

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent

This guidance document provides practical direction for developing and implementing Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs) for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). It supplements the formal Specification by offering context, best practices, and recommendations for effective hazard identification and control.

### 1.2 Audience

- HSE personnel
- Site supervisors and foremen
- Engineering leads
- Craft workers
- Construction management team

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Worker Involvement** | Engage workers who perform the tasks in JHA development |
| **Task-Specific** | Focus on specific work activities, not general hazards |
| **Proactive** | Complete JHA before work begins, not after incidents |
| **Practical** | Define feasible and implementable controls |
| **Living Document** | Update JHA when conditions or activities change |

### 2.2 Guiding Philosophy

The JHA is a fundamental safety tool that empowers workers to recognize and mitigate hazards before they cause harm. Effective JHAs:
- Break work into manageable steps
- Identify specific hazards at each step
- Define practical controls that workers can implement
- Serve as training and communication tools
- Create a record of hazard management

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Scope Determination

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Work Activity Selection** | Develop JHAs for each distinct work activity, not just each site. A single site may require multiple JHAs. |
| **Granularity** | Balance detail with usability. Tasks should be specific enough to identify hazards but not so detailed as to be impractical. |
| **Priority** | Focus first on high-risk activities, new tasks, and tasks with injury history. |

### 3.2 Development Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Team Composition** | Include workers who will perform the task, supervisors, and HSE personnel. |
| **Site Visit** | When possible, conduct JHA development at the actual work site to observe conditions. |
| **Equipment Review** | Consider equipment, tools, and materials used in the task. |
| **Environmental Factors** | Account for weather, lighting, noise, and other environmental conditions. |

### 3.3 Hazard Identification Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **What-If Analysis** | Ask "What could go wrong?" for each task step |
| **Energy Analysis** | Identify energy sources (electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal) that could cause harm |
| **Previous Incidents** | Review incident history for similar tasks |
| **Regulatory Requirements** | Check applicable safety regulations for required controls |

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 JHA Granularity

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Detailed JHA** (many task steps) | Comprehensive; identifies more hazards | Time-consuming; may be unwieldy in field |
| **High-Level JHA** (fewer steps) | Quick to develop; easy to reference | May miss specific hazards |

**Recommendation:** Use 5-10 task steps per JHA as a guideline. If more steps are needed, consider breaking into multiple JHAs for sub-activities.

### 4.2 Control Specificity

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Specific Controls** (named PPE, procedures) | Clear implementation; verifiable | May not cover variations |
| **General Controls** (categories of protection) | Flexible; adaptable | May lack clarity for workers |

**Recommendation:** Be specific. Name the exact PPE required, reference specific procedures, and identify responsible parties.

### 4.3 Review Frequency

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Daily Review** | Catches changing conditions | Time burden |
| **Per-Task Review** | Ensures awareness | May become routine |
| **Event-Triggered Review** | Efficient; focuses resources | May miss gradual changes |

**Recommendation:** Review JHA with crew before starting each task. Conduct formal revision when conditions change materially.

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Sample JHA Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Header | JHA number, site, activity, date, prepared by, approved by |
| Task Steps | Sequential list of steps to complete the work |
| Hazards | Identified hazards for each step |
| Risk Rating | Severity x Probability (optional but recommended) |
| Controls | Specific mitigation measures |
| Responsible | Person/role responsible for implementing controls |
| Sign-off | Approval signatures; worker acknowledgment |

### 5.2 Sample Task Step Hazard Analysis

| Task Step | Hazards | Controls | Responsible |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Set up work area | Slip/trip hazards; overhead hazards | Clear debris; identify overhead obstructions; cone off area | Foreman |
| 2. Operate crane for lift | Struck-by; crush hazard; electrical contact | Use signal person; tag line; verify clearances | Crane operator / Signal person |
| 3. Connect rigging | Hand injury; dropped load | Inspect rigging; use gloves; secure connection | Rigger |

### 5.3 Sample Hazard Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Struck-by | Moving equipment, falling objects, swinging loads |
| Caught-in/between | Rotating equipment, pinch points, excavations |
| Falls | From height, same level (slips/trips) |
| Electrical | Contact with energized systems, static discharge |
| Chemical | Exposure to hazardous substances, spills |
| Ergonomic | Lifting, repetitive motion, awkward postures |
| Environmental | Heat/cold stress, noise, weather |

## 6. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Generic JHA** | Develop JHAs specific to the actual task and site conditions |
| **Desk-Developed JHA** | Involve workers; visit the work site during development |
| **Missing Hazards** | Use systematic hazard identification techniques; get multiple perspectives |
| **Impractical Controls** | Verify controls are feasible; get worker input on implementation |
| **Stale JHA** | Review and update when conditions change; date and version control |
| **No Worker Involvement** | Review JHA with workers before task; obtain acknowledgment |
| **Paper Exercise Only** | Verify controls are actually implemented in the field |

## 7. Integration with Project Safety

### 7.1 Relationship to CMR (DEL-00.11)

The JHA and CMR are companion documents:
- CMR confirms site readiness (completion status)
- JHA confirms work activity safety (hazard controls)
- Both required before proceeding with work at each site
- Cross-reference each other for consistency

### 7.2 Relationship to Risk Management Plan (DEL-00.08)

- Risk Management Plan provides overall risk approach
- JHA implements risk management at the task level
- JHA hazard categories should align with project risk framework

---

## 8. Notes and Assumptions

1. **ASSUMPTION:** JHA template to be provided by TM or based on industry-standard format.
2. **ASSUMPTION:** JHAs are activity-specific; one site may require multiple JHAs.
3. **TBD:** TM JHA requirements and approval workflow.
4. **TBD:** Worker acknowledgment format and record retention.
5. **ASSUMPTION:** JHA development involves workers who perform the tasks.
