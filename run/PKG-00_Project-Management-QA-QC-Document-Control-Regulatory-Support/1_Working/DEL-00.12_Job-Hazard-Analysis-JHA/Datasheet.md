## 3. Conditions

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- TM JHA template or format requirements
- Work site identification and scope definition
- Understanding of work activities to be performed
- Familiarity with site-specific hazards

### 3.2 Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| JHA Template/Format | TM or Contractor HSE | **TBD** |
| Site Scope Definition | Project Execution Plan | Pending |
| Site Hazard Information | Site surveys, existing documentation | **TBD** |
| CMR (companion document) | DEL-00.11 | Parallel development |

### 3.3 Constraints

- JHA must be completed prior to proceeding with work at each site (SOW: Section 4.2.3.9)
- JHA must be communicated to all workers performing the analyzed tasks
- JHA must be site-specific and activity-specific

## 4. Construction / Compilation

### 4.1 Development Approach

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Planning | Obtain JHA template; identify sites and activities requiring JHA |
| Hazard Identification | Analyze work activities; identify hazards and risks |
| Control Development | Define mitigation measures for each identified hazard |
| Review | Internal HSE review; worker input/acknowledgment |
| Implementation | Communicate JHA to workforce; implement controls |

### 4.2 Update Frequency

- **ASSUMPTION:** JHA updated when work activities or site conditions change
- JHA revision if new hazards are identified or controls are modified
- Periodic review during work execution

### 4.3 Quality Control

- Internal HSE review prior to implementation
- Worker involvement in JHA development
- Verification of control implementation
