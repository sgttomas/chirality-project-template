## 1. Overview
This guidance document provides direction for preparing and conducting design reviews for the PSO project. Design reviews are formal checkpoints where engineering progress is presented to TM and key stakeholders for approval to proceed to the next phase. These reviews are separate from HAZOP and risk assessment activities.

## 2. Key Principles

### 2.1 Preparation is Critical
- Design reviews are high-visibility events; thorough preparation is essential
- Materials should be reviewed internally before presentation to TM
- Anticipate questions and prepare supporting data

### 2.2 Honest Status Reporting
- Present accurate status even when progress is behind plan
- Identify issues early rather than waiting for problems to escalate
- Be transparent about risks and challenges

### 2.3 Action-Oriented Outcomes
- Reviews should result in clear decisions (approve, hold, revise)
- All feedback should be captured as trackable actions
- Actions should have clear owners and realistic due dates

### 2.4 Stakeholder Engagement
- Design reviews are opportunities to engage TM stakeholders
- Solicit feedback from operations, maintenance, and other affected parties
- Document and address all concerns raised

## 3. Review Types and Timing (**ASSUMPTION**)

### 3.1 Review Milestones
| Review | Timing | Primary Purpose |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| FEED Design Review | End of FEED | Confirm design basis; approve transition to Detailed Design |
| 30% DD Review | 30% completion | Verify layout, long-lead items, major systems |
| 60% DD Review | 60% completion | Confirm detailed design progress, vendor integration |
| 90% DD Review | 90% completion | Verify IFC readiness, confirm action closeout |

### 3.2 Review Readiness Criteria (**ASSUMPTION**)
| Review | Key Prerequisites |
|--------|-------------------|
| FEED Design Review | P&IDs IFR complete, equipment sized, preliminary layout approved |
| 30% DD Review | Plot plans issued, major equipment ordered, pipe routing defined |
| 60% DD Review | Vendor data integrated, stress analysis in progress, I&C design advanced |
| 90% DD Review | All critical calculations complete, all HAZOP actions closed, IFC drawings in review |

## 4. Presentation Content Guidance

### 4.1 Required Topics (per SOW)

| Firewater | Fire protection design status | Is fire protection adequate for the design? |
| Foundations/Seismic | Civil/structural status, seismic design | Are foundations designed? Is seismic addressed? |
| Control System | I&C design status, MAC coordination | Is the control system design progressing? Is MAC aligned? |
| Vendor Data | Equipment data integration status | Is vendor data being received and integrated? |
| Constructability | Constructability assessment findings | Have constructability issues been identified and addressed? |

### 4.2 Status Summaries to Include
| Summary | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Schedule Status | Overall progress vs. plan, critical path items, recovery actions |

| Action Status | Prior review actions, HAZOP actions, LP/HF actions |
| Risk Status | Key risks, mitigation progress, new risks identified |
| Interface Status | Interface register summary, critical interfaces |
| Change Status | Design changes since last review, impact assessment |

### 4.3 Presentation Structure (**ASSUMPTION**)
| Section | Suggested Duration | Content |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Introduction | 5-10 min | Agenda, attendees, review objectives |
| Project Status Overview | 10-15 min | Schedule, budget, key metrics |
| Design Status by Discipline | 30-45 min | Each discipline presents status |
| Cross-Cutting Topics | 20-30 min | Interfaces, risk, constructability |
| Action Status | 10-15 min | Prior actions, closeout summary |
| Discussion | 20-30 min | TM questions, feedback |
| Next Steps | 5-10 min | Actions from this review, path forward |

## 5. Presentation Best Practices

### 5.1 Slide Design
- Use consistent template throughout presentation
- Limit text; use visuals (drawings, charts, photos) where possible
- Ensure text is readable from back of room (min 18pt font)
- Include page numbers and date for reference

### 5.2 Data Presentation
- Present quantitative data where possible (% complete, action counts)
- Use traffic light status (red/yellow/green) for quick visual assessment
- Reference source documents for key data points
- Highlight changes from previous review

### 5.3 Issue Presentation
- Present issues honestly but constructively
- For each issue, describe: what it is, why it matters, what is being done
- Have recovery plans ready for significant issues
- Don't surprise TM; communicate major issues before review if possible

## 6. Supporting Materials

### 6.1 Pre-Review Distribution
| Material | Distribution Timing |
|----------|---------------------|
| Draft presentation | 3-5 days before review |
| Key drawings | 3-5 days before review |
| Action status report | 3-5 days before review |
| Agenda | 1 week before review |

### 6.2 Materials to Have Available at Review
- Complete drawing set (electronic access or printed sets)
- 3D model access for virtual walkthroughs
- Equipment datasheets and specifications
- Calculations and analysis reports
- Vendor documentation
- Prior review minutes and actions

## 7. Meeting Facilitation

### 7.1 Meeting Roles
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Chairperson | Lead meeting, manage time, facilitate discussion |
| Presenter(s) | Present discipline content, answer questions |
| Note Taker | Capture minutes, action items, decisions |
| Technical Expert(s) | Available to address detailed technical questions |

### 7.2 Time Management
- Stick to agenda timing; adjust if running over
- Park detailed technical discussions for offline follow-up
- Ensure all required topics are covered
- Allow adequate time for discussion

### 7.3 Action Capture
- Capture all actions during meeting (don't rely on memory)
- Assign owner immediately when action is raised
- Agree on due dates before closing action item
- Read back actions at end of meeting for confirmation

## 8. Post-Review Activities

### 8.1 Minutes Preparation
- Draft minutes within 2-3 days of review
- Include: attendees, topics discussed, decisions made, actions assigned
- Circulate draft for comment before finalizing
- Distribute final minutes to all attendees and stakeholders

### 8.2 Action Tracking
- Enter all actions in project action tracking system
- Notify action owners of their assignments
- Track progress and report at project meetings
- Escalate overdue actions per project procedures

### 8.3 Design Update
- Incorporate review feedback into design
- Update affected documents and drawings
- Track design changes through change control
- Verify changes are captured in next review status

## 9. Review Outcomes

### 9.1 Decision Categories (**ASSUMPTION**)
| Outcome | Definition | Follow-up Required |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Approved | Design may proceed to next phase | Track actions; proceed with work |
| Approved with Comments | Design proceeds; specific issues to address | Close comment actions before next milestone |
| Hold | Design paused pending issue resolution | Resolve identified issues; schedule re-review |
| Major Revision | Significant rework required | Develop recovery plan; schedule re-review |

### 9.2 Approval Documentation
- Document review decision in minutes
- Obtain formal approval signature if required by TM
- File approval documentation in project records
- Reference approval in project status reports

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Insufficient preparation | Poor presentation, missed issues | Start preparation 2+ weeks before review |
| Presenting incomplete work | Loss of confidence, delays | Verify readiness before scheduling review |
| Defensive responses | Poor stakeholder relationship | Accept feedback gracefully; commit to resolution |
| No action tracking | Issues remain unresolved | Capture and track all actions rigorously |
| Skipping follow-up | Actions drift; issues recur | Report action status at project meetings |
