# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.10 Design Review Presentation Package(s)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides structured communication vehicles for formal design milestone reviews, enabling informed decision-making about engineering progress and quality. It must carry knowledge of how to synthesize multi-discipline status information into coherent presentations that demonstrate readiness to proceed to subsequent design phases.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
