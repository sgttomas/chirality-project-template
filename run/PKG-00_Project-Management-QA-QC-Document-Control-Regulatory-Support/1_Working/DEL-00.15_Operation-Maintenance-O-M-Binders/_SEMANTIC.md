# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.15 Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Binders

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Binders serve as the compiled reference documentation that enables facility operations and maintenance personnel to safely and effectively operate and maintain installed equipment throughout its lifecycle. This deliverable must carry knowledge about equipment identification, operational guidance, maintenance requirements, troubleshooting approaches, and spare parts, organized in an accessible structure that supports both routine operations and issue resolution.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
