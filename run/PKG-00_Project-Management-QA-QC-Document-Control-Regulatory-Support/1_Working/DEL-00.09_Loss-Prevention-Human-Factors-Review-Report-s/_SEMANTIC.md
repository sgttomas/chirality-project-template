# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.09 Loss Prevention & Human Factors Review Report(s)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides structured documentation of loss prevention and human factors reviews conducted at progressive design stages, capturing findings that address how physical design configurations interact with hazards and human performance. The report series serves to demonstrate that safety-critical design features have been systematically evaluated against loss prevention and human factors principles, and that identified deficiencies are tracked to verifiable closeout before final design issuance.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens is not authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
