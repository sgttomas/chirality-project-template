## Document Information
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deliverable ID | DEL-00.09 |
| Deliverable Name | Loss Prevention & Human Factors Review Report(s) |
| Revision | 0 (Initial Draft) |
| Status | INITIALIZED |
| Date | 2026-02-01 |

## 1. Overview
This guidance document provides direction for producing LP and HF review reports throughout the PSO project. Reports demonstrate that reviews have been conducted per DEL-00.08 Risk Management Plan and that findings are tracked to closeout.

## 2. Key Principles

### 2.1 Objective Documentation
- Record all findings, not just negative ones
- Document design features that meet LP/HF requirements
- Provide clear evidence for compliance demonstration

### 2.2 Actionable Findings
- Each finding should be specific and locatable
- Recommendations should be practical and implementable
- Action owners should be able to address findings independently

### 2.3 Traceable Closeout
- Every action needs documented closeout evidence
- Evidence should be specific (drawing revision, calculation, photo)
- Closeout should be verifiable by independent reviewer

## 3. Report Content Guidance

### 3.1 Executive Summary
- Provide high-level findings count (critical/high/medium/low)
- Highlight any showstoppers or significant concerns
- State overall assessment of design maturity for LP/HF
- Summarize action status (open vs. closed)

### 3.2 Review Scope Section
- Clearly define what was reviewed (areas, systems, drawings)
- State any exclusions or limitations
- Reference the specific design basis/revision reviewed
- Note any areas deferred to future reviews

### 3.3 Review Team Section
- List all participants and their roles
- Include relevant qualifications/experience
- Note TM participation (if applicable)
- Identify review facilitator

### 3.4 Methodology Section
- Reference checklists used (provide in appendix)
- Describe review technique (walkthrough, workshop, model review)
- Note any standards referenced
- State any tools used (3D model, VR, mockups)

## 4. Loss Prevention Finding Categories

### 4.1 Process Safety Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Containment | Pump seal leak path not contained | Add drip pan beneath pump seals |
| Pressure Protection | Relief valve discharge routing unclear | Clarify relief discharge routing on P&ID |
| Isolation | Isolation valves not labeled on P&ID | Add valve tags for isolation valves |
| Detection | No leak detection in pump area | Add hydrocarbon detection in pump room |

### 4.2 Fire Protection Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Classification | Area classification boundary unclear | Clarify hazardous area extent on drawings |
| Detection | Smoke detector coverage gap | Add detector in northwest corner |
| Suppression | Firewater coverage questionable | Verify firewater throw radius calculation |
| Separation | Equipment spacing appears insufficient | Verify spacing meets API 2510 requirements |

### 4.3 Emergency Response Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Access | Emergency access route blocked | Relocate equipment to maintain access |
| Shutdown | ESD button not visible | Add signage for ESD location |
| Egress | Only one exit from pump area | Add second egress route |
| Communication | No emergency communication device | Add emergency call point |

## 5. Human Factors Finding Categories

### 5.1 Operability Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Control Interface | Pump start/stop logic unclear | Simplify control sequence in HMI |
| Visibility | Local pressure gauge not visible | Relocate gauge for operator visibility |
| Procedure | Startup sequence not defined | Develop startup procedure |
| Feedback | No VFD speed indication locally | Add local speed display |

### 5.2 Maintainability Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Access | Insufficient clearance for pump removal | Increase maintenance aisle width |
| Lifting | No lifting provision for pump motor | Add monorail or davit arm |
| Tools | Valve handwheel inaccessible | Extend handwheel or add chain operator |
| Isolation | Maintenance isolation points unclear | Add maintenance isolation diagram |

### 5.3 Safety/Ergonomic Findings
| Finding Type | Example Finding | Example Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Noise | VFD area expected to exceed 85 dBA | Add acoustic encloseout or ear protection requirement |
| Lighting | Inadequate lighting at pump skid | Add task lighting |
| Tripping | Cable routing creates trip hazard | Route cables overhead or in tray |
| Heat | Heat exposure from adjacent equipment | Add heat shield or ventilation |

## 6. Action Register Best Practices

### 6.1 Writing Effective Actions
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about what needs to change | Use vague language ("improve", "consider") |
| Reference specific drawing/document | Leave location ambiguous |
| Set realistic due dates | Use "ASAP" or leave blank |
| Assign to single owner | Assign to multiple people or groups |

### 6.2 Priority Assignment (ASSUMPTION)
| Priority | Criteria | Response Expectation |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Critical | Safety-related or blocks IFC | Must resolve before next milestone |
| High | Significant LP/HF concern | Resolve within 30 days |
| Medium | Moderate concern | Resolve within 60 days |
| Low | Minor observation | Resolve before IFC |

### 6.3 Closeout Evidence Examples
| Action Type | Acceptable Evidence |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Drawing change | Revised drawing with change cloud |
| Calculation | Calculation reference showing resolution |
| Procedure | Procedure document reference |
| Physical change | Photo or as-built confirmation |
| Acceptance | Documented acceptance of as-is condition |

## 7. Coordination with Other Deliverables

| Related Deliverable | Coordination Point |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| DEL-00.08 Risk Management Plan | Governs review approach and criteria |
| DEL-00.10 Design Review Packages | LP/HF status presented at design reviews |
| DEL-01.15 HAZOP Final Report | Coordinate action tracking to avoid duplication |
| All discipline packages | Findings may require discipline-specific updates |

## 8. PSO-Specific Considerations

### 8.1 VS6 Booster Pump Areas
- Seal systems and leak containment
- Noise levels and personnel exposure
- Maintenance access and lifting provisions
- Local monitoring and control provisions

### 8.2 VFD Installations
- Electrical hazards and area classification

- EMI/RFI considerations
- Access for maintenance

### 8.3 New Containment Wall
- Drainage and leak detection
- Access through/over wall
- Fire protection considerations
- Structural integrity

### 8.4 5x6 Manifold
- Valve accessibility
- Pigging provisions (if applicable)
- Isolation provisions
- Blending control visibility
