## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable (External Responsibility Matrix).
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The ERM perspective emphasizes accountability partitioning, interface clarity, communication obligations, and responsibility conflict prevention across multi-party project execution.
