## 3. Conditions

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- System/sub-system boundary definitions
- Understanding of construction sequence
- TM turnover requirements
- Performance testing criteria

### 3.2 Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| System Definitions | Engineering Design (PKG-01, PKG-02, etc.) | Pending |
| Construction Sequence | Construction Planning | **TBD** |
| TM Turnover Requirements | TM | **TBD** |
| Performance Test Criteria | TM / Process (PKG-01) | **TBD** |

### 3.3 Constraints

- Plan must support TM's systems completion and turnover process
- Plan must define engineering support approach per SOW
- Plan must align with construction and commissioning schedule

---

## 4. Construction / Compilation

### 4.1 Development Approach

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Planning | Define systems/sub-systems; establish completion philosophy |
| Development | Develop completion sequence, turnover packages, testing approach |
| Coordination | Align with construction, commissioning, and startup teams |
| Review | Internal review; TM review and agreement |
| Implementation | Execute per plan during construction/completion phases |

### 4.2 Update Frequency

- Initial submission during FEED or early Detailed Design
- Updates as required when systems or approach changes
- Final update prior to construction completion activities

### 4.3 Quality Control

- Internal review by project management and engineering leads
- Alignment check with construction and commissioning plans
- TM review and agreement
