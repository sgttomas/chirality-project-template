## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines the requirements for the Systems Completion Plan to be developed by the Engineering Contractor for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). The Systems Completion Plan describes the approach for systems completion activities, including engineering support for startup and performance testing.

### 1.2 Applicability

This specification applies to:
- All systems and sub-systems within PSO scope at Sumas Tank Farm
- Mechanical completion, pre-commissioning, commissioning, and startup activities
- Engineering support requirements during construction and systems completion

### 1.3 Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Systems completion philosophy and approach
- System/sub-system definitions and completion sequence
- Turnover package structure
- Engineering support during completion activities
- Performance testing support approach

**Out of Scope:**
- Detailed commissioning procedures (by others unless specifically required)
- Operations startup procedures (TM responsibility)
- Construction execution plans (by construction contractor)
