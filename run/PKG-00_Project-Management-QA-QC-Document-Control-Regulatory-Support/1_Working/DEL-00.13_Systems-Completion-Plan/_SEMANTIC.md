# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.13 Systems Completion Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Systems Completion Plan exists to orchestrate the systematic transition of constructed facility systems from construction-complete status through pre-commissioning, commissioning, and startup phases into verified operational readiness. It ensures that each system is properly defined with clear boundaries, sequenced according to dependencies and safety priorities, supported by appropriate engineering resources, and documented comprehensively for turnover and handover to operations.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the Systems Completion Plan deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure to identify gaps, redundancies, or misalignments.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars (specific system names, dates, acceptance criteria values) are resolved downstream in WORKING_ITEMS sessions.
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these matrices as evidence for requirements or parameters. They are question-shaping scaffolds.
- Key semantic themes for this deliverable:
  - **Completion orchestration**: transitioning systems through defined phases
  - **Boundary definition**: establishing clear system and sub-system boundaries
  - **Sequence logic**: ordering completion activities by dependency and safety priority
  - **Engineering support**: defining support scope and resources
  - **Turnover documentation**: ensuring comprehensive handover packages
  - **Performance verification**: confirming systems meet design intent
