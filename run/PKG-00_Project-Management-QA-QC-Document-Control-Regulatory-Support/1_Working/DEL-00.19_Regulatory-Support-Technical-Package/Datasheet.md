## 3. Conditions

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- Relevant engineering deliverables at appropriate completion level
- TM request for specific regulatory support documentation
- Understanding of regulatory authority requirements
- P.Eng. with appropriate jurisdictional license available (if stamped documents required)
- Equipment registration requirements defined in purchase orders
- Regulatory Coordinator assigned to track requests and coordinate activities

### 3.2 Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Status |

## 4. Construction / Compilation

### 4.1 Development Approach

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Request Receipt | Receive and log TM request for regulatory support |
| Requirements Definition | Clarify scope, format, timing requirements |
| Document Preparation | Prepare/extract/format required documentation |
| Review | Technical review and P.Eng. stamp (if required) |
| Submission | Submit to TM for regulatory use |
| Follow-up | Support regulatory queries as needed |

### 4.2 Request Types

| Request Type | Typical Content | Timing |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Permit Application Support | Drawings, calculations, compliance info | Per permit schedule |
| Safety Codes Officer Meeting | Presentation materials, design overview | Per engagement plan |
| Regulatory Query Response | Technical clarifications, supplemental info | As queries arise |
| Equipment Registration Coordination | CRN, ABSA, BCSA tracking, vendor coordination | During procurement |
| Technical Presentation Support | Slide decks, talking points | As scheduled |

### 4.3 Tracking Requirements

- Maintain log of all regulatory support requests
- Track status of each request (open, in progress, submitted, closed)
- Track equipment registrations (CRN, ABSA, BCSA)
- Maintain P.Eng. stamp register for stamped documents
