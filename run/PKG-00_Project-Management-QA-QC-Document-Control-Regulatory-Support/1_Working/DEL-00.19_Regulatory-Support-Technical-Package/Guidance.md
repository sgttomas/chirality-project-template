## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Regulatory submissions must be technically correct; errors cause delays |
| **Compliance** | All documentation must meet applicable codes, standards, and regulations |
| **Timeliness** | Regulatory support must align with permit/approval schedules |
| **Coordination** | TM leads regulatory strategy; contractor provides technical support |
| **Professionalism** | All stamped documents require proper P.Eng. review and authorization |

### 2.2 Guiding Philosophy

Effective regulatory support is critical to project success. Regulatory delays can impact construction schedules and project costs. The engineering contractor's role is to provide high-quality technical documentation that:
- Demonstrates design compliance with applicable codes and standards
- Supports TM's regulatory applications and permit processes
- Enables successful regulatory reviews and approvals
- Ensures equipment meets certification requirements

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Regulatory Landscape

| Jurisdiction | Authority | Typical Scope |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Federal (CER)** | Canada Energy Regulator | Interprovincial pipeline matters |
| **Alberta** | ABSA (pressure equipment), AER (energy), APEGA (engineering) | Pressure vessels, piping, equipment |
| **British Columbia** | BCSA (safety codes), EGBC (engineering) | Safety code compliance, electrical |
| **Municipal** | Local building authorities | Building permits, land use |

### 3.2 Planning Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Early Engagement** | Develop Safety Codes Officer engagement plan early; identify key regulatory milestones |
| **Jurisdictional Clarity** | Confirm which jurisdictions apply to each project element |
| **P.Eng. Resources** | Ensure P.Eng. resources available with valid APEGA and EGBC licenses |
| **Equipment Registration** | Specify CRN, ABSA, BCSA requirements in purchase orders from the start |
| **File Naming Conventions** | Confirm TM file naming conventions early (**TBD: specific conventions**) |

### 3.3 Equipment Registration

| Equipment Type | Registration Requirement | Responsibility |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Pressure Vessels | CRN required | Vendor (specified by contractor) |
| Pressure Piping | CRN may be required | Vendor or contractor |
| Safety Valves (PSVs/PRVs) | CRN required | Vendor |
| Packaged Equipment | CRN for pressure components | Vendor |

**Key Practice:** Include CRN/registration requirements in ALL pressure equipment purchase orders at time of issue.

### 3.4 P.Eng. Stamping

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **Review Before Stamping** | P.Eng. must review work before applying stamp |
| **Jurisdiction Matching** | Stamp must be valid for submission jurisdiction |
| **Stamp Register** | Maintain register of all stamped documents |
| **Stamp Validity** | Verify P.Eng. license is current at time of stamping |

### 3.5 Response Timeline Considerations

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| **TBD Timeline Requirements** | Establish specific response timelines with TM for each request type |
| **Query Response Priority** | Regulatory queries typically require rapid response to avoid delays |
| **Coordination Time** | Allow time for technical review, P.Eng. stamping, and internal approvals |
| **Tracking** | Maintain regulatory support request log to track response times |

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Engagement Timing

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Early Engagement** | More time to resolve issues; builds relationships | Design may evolve |
| **Just-in-Time** | Design more mature | Less time for issue resolution |
| **Staged Engagement** | Balanced approach | Requires more coordination |

**Recommendation:** Early engagement with staged reviews as design matures. This is specified in SOW and is industry best practice.

### 4.2 Documentation Depth

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Comprehensive** | Reduces follow-up queries | More preparation effort |
| **Minimal Required** | Faster initial submission | May trigger more queries |
| **Tailored** | Matches authority expectations | Requires knowledge of authority preferences |

**Recommendation:** Understand regulatory authority expectations and tailor documentation accordingly. Err on the side of completeness for initial submissions.

### 4.3 Registration Approach

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Vendor Responsibility** | Leverages vendor expertise | Less direct control |
| **Contractor Direct** | More control | Additional resources required |
| **Hybrid** | Balance of control and efficiency | Coordination complexity |

**Recommendation:** Standard practice is vendor responsibility with contractor coordination and tracking. Specify requirements clearly in purchase orders.

| **Missed regulatory requirements** | Engage Safety Codes Officers early; confirm requirements before detailed design |
| **Delayed query responses** | Establish response protocols; prioritize regulatory queries |
| **Incomplete submissions** | Understand regulatory authority expectations; provide comprehensive initial submissions |
| **Vendor registration delays** | Track vendor registrations proactively; escalate delays early |
| **Unstamped documents submitted** | Establish checklist for regulatory submissions; verify stamps before transmittal |
| **File naming errors** | Confirm TM file naming conventions early; establish naming templates |
