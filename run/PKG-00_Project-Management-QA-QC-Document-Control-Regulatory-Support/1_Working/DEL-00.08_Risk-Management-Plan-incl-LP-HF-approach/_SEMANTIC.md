# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.08 Risk Management Plan (incl LP/HF approach)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the framework for identifying, evaluating, mitigating, and tracking risks throughout the project lifecycle, integrating loss prevention considerations for process safety and human factors considerations for operability and maintainability. It must carry knowledge about how risk categories are classified, how assessments are conducted, how findings are tracked to closure, and how risk activities integrate with design review processes.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
