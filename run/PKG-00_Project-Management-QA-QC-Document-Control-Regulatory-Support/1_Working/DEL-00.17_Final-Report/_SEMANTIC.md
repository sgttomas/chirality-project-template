# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.17 Final Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable is a comprehensive project-closing report that compiles and synthesizes all FEED and Detailed Design engineering documentation into an authoritative summary. It serves as the narrative companion to the FD Package, providing integrated context for work performed, summaries of design decisions and deviations across all disciplines, and actionable recommendations for construction and commissioning phases.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
