# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.04 Design Change Control Log

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Design Change Control Log exists to maintain authoritative traceability for all design changes, deviations, and modifications throughout engineering phases. It must carry knowledge of change classification, approval workflows, affected document linkages, and implementation status to ensure design integrity and audit compliance.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
**Inputs Read:**

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
