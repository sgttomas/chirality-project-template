# Semantic Lens: DEL-00.05 Interface Management Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Interface Management Plan exists to establish the structured framework for identifying, documenting, coordinating, and resolving points of interaction between organizational entities, disciplines, and external parties. It carries knowledge about boundary definition, responsibility allocation, communication protocols, and escalation pathways that enable coordinated design development across multiple stakeholders.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
