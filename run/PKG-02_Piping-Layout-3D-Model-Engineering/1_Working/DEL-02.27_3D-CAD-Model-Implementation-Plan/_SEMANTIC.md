# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.27 3D CAD Model Implementation Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The 3D CAD Model Implementation Plan establishes the governance framework for multi-discipline digital modeling throughout project lifecycle phases, defining how spatial coordination, data integrity, and deliverable extraction shall be structured and maintained. It bridges strategy (model philosophy) with practice (workflows and procedures), enabling consistent digital asset development for brownfield integration.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
