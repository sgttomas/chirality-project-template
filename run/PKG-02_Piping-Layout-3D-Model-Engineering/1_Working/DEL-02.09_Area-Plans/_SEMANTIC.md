# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.09 Area Plans

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Area Plans deliverable exists to provide spatially-organized plan views that partition project zones into comprehensible layout drawings, enabling multi-discipline coordination and construction execution through the accurate representation of equipment positions, piping routes, access provisions, and safety boundaries within defined area extents.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the DEL-02.09 Area Plans deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure to identify gaps, missing categories, or incomplete coverage.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars (specific equipment tags, dimensions, coordinates) are resolved downstream in WORKING_ITEMS sessions.
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these semantic structures as evidence for requirements, parameters, or compliance claims.
- The Area Plans perspective emphasizes spatial organization, multi-discipline coordination, and construction enablement through accurate representation of equipment positions, piping routes, access provisions, and safety boundaries.
