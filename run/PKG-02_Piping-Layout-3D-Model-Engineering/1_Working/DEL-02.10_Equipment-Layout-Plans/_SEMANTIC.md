# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.10 Equipment Layout Plans

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Equipment Layout Plans exist to document the precise physical arrangement, dimensional configuration, and interface requirements of major mechanical equipment, enabling coordinated foundation design, piping routing, and installation planning while maintaining traceability between vendor specifications and site integration.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable (Equipment Layout Plans).
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The Equipment Layout Plans deliverable specifically benefits from:
  - **Normative lenses** for code compliance, standards adherence, and regulatory requirements
  - **Operative lenses** for functional equipment arrangement, dimensional coordination, and installation planning
  - **Evaluative lenses** for quality verification, accuracy checking, and vendor data validation
