# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.07 Piping Plan for Sump Tank

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable represents a piping plan drawing for a sump tank system, defining the spatial arrangement and routing of piping, equipment, and instrumentation that enables collection, processing, and reinjection of fluids from secondary containment areas. The drawing must communicate the physical configuration and dimensional information necessary for construction, while maintaining alignment with process requirements and coordination across multiple engineering disciplines.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
