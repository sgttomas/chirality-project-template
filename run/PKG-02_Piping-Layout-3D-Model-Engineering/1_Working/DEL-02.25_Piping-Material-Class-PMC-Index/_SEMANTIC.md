# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.25 Piping Material Class (PMC) Index

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The PMC Index serves as the authoritative registry that identifies, organizes, and tracks all piping material classes applicable to a project, providing traceability between material classification codes and their detailed specifications. It carries the knowledge necessary for coordinating material selection, version control, and change management across piping engineering disciplines.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
