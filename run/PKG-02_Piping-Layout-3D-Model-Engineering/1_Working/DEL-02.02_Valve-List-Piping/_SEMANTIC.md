# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.02 Valve List (Piping)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Valve List serves as the master register for all valves within piping scope, enabling traceability from process design through procurement, construction, and maintenance. It must carry knowledge of valve identity, type, service conditions, material specifications, and operator requirements sufficient to support downstream procurement, installation verification, and operational integrity.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the Valve List (Piping) deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The Valve List perspective emphasizes: traceability (P&ID to valve to procurement), completeness (all valves captured), consistency (uniform data across entries), and accuracy (matching source documents).
