# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.12 Piping General Arrangement (GA) Drawings

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable communicates the spatial arrangement, routing, and interconnection of piping systems within a brownfield facility context. It enables construction planning, multi-discipline coordination, and verification of process flow paths by depicting equipment connections, instrument locations, and infrastructure elements in organized plan, section, and elevation views.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
