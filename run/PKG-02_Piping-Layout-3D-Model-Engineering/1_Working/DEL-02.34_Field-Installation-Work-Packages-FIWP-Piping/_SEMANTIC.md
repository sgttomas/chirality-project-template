# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.34 Field Installation Work Packages (FIWP) - Piping

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides the structured packaging of piping installation work into crew-executable units that ensure materials, information, quality, and safety requirements are bundled and constraint-free before field release. The FIWP serves as the final coordination vehicle between engineering design outputs and field construction execution.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
