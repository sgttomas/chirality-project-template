# Guidance: Field Installation Work Packages (FIWP) - Piping

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent
This guidance document provides direction on developing Field Installation Work Packages (FIWPs) for piping scope on the Puget Sound Optimization Project, addressing practical considerations, AWP methodology, and project-specific requirements.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Work Package Coordinators
- Piping Foremen
- Construction Supervisors
- Material Coordinators
- QC Inspectors

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Constraint-Free Release** | FIWPs released only when all constraints cleared |
| **Crew-Sized Scope** | Scope sized for efficient crew execution (1-2 weeks) |
| **Complete Information** | All information needed for execution included |
| **Quality Integration** | Quality requirements embedded in package |
| **Safety Focus** | Safety requirements clearly documented |

### 2.2 AWP Hierarchy (**ASSUMPTION**)
```
Construction Work Package (CWP)
    └── Field Installation Work Package (FIWP)
            ├── Material Kit
            ├── Drawings
            ├── Work Instructions
            ├── Quality Plan
            └── Safety Plan
```

### 2.3 FIWP Development Flow
```
CWP Release → FIWP Planning → Constraint Removal → Material Kitting → FIWP Release → Execution → Closeout
```

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Project-Specific Considerations

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Brownfield Environment** | FIWPs must address operating plant constraints |
| **Tie-In Work** | Separate FIWPs for shutdown-dependent work |
| **Prefabrication** | Coordinate shop FIWPs with field FIWPs |
| **Weather** | Consider weather limitations in FIWP planning |
| **Crew Continuity** | Size FIWPs to maintain crew momentum |

### 3.2 Technical Considerations

| Topic | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| **Material Kitting** | 100% materials verified and kitted before release |
| **Scaffold Planning** | Scaffold in place or planned before FIWP release |
| **Weld Sequence** | Consider weld sequence for access and distortion |
| **NDE Staging** | Plan NDE inspection windows |
| **Hold Points** | Document mandatory hold points clearly |

### 3.3 Constraint Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Engineering | Drawing revision, RFI pending |
| Material | Material not received, shortage |
| Access | Scaffold not erected, equipment in way |
| Predecessor | Prior work not complete |
| Permit | Hot work permit, confined space |
| Resource | Crew not available, tool shortage |

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 FIWP Sizing

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Small FIWPs (500 hr)** | Faster constraint clearance, flexible | More packages, admin overhead |
| **Large FIWPs (2000 hr)** | Fewer packages, complete scope | Longer to clear constraints |
| **Task-Based** | Clear work breakdown | May not optimize labor |
| **Location-Based** | Minimizes crew movement | May split work types |

**ASSUMPTION**: Target 500-1500 manhours per FIWP for this project.

### 4.2 Release Timing

| Trade-off | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Early vs. Late Release** | Release 1 week ahead if constraint-free |
| **Batch vs. Individual** | Release in logical batches to maintain flow |
| **Rigid vs. Flexible** | Allow FIWP modifications with proper change control |

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Sample FIWP Cover Sheet

| Field | Example Value |
|-------|---------------|
| FIWP ID | FIWP-PIP-001-01 |
| Parent CWP | CWP-PIP-001 |
| FIWP Title | P-101 Discharge Piping Installation |
| Work Description | Install discharge spool from P-101 to check valve |
| Drawings | ISO-PIP-101-001, ISO-PIP-101-002 |
| Material Kit | MK-PIP-001-01 |
| Weld Count | 12 field welds |
| Estimated Manhours | 320 |
| Crew Size | 4 pipefitters + 2 welders |
| Duration | 5 days |
| Constraints | Materials (cleared), Scaffold (in progress) |
| Status | Pending Release |

### 5.2 Sample FIWP Breakdown for Pump CWP

| FIWP ID | Scope | Manhours |
|---------|-------|----------|
| FIWP-PIP-001-01 | Suction spool fabrication | 200 |
| FIWP-PIP-001-02 | Suction spool installation | 300 |
| FIWP-PIP-001-03 | Discharge spool fabrication | 250 |
| FIWP-PIP-001-04 | Discharge spool installation | 320 |
| FIWP-PIP-001-05 | Supports installation | 180 |
| FIWP-PIP-001-06 | Final connections | 120 |

### 5.3 Common Issues to Avoid
1. Releasing FIWP with uncleared constraints
2. Incomplete material kits (missing bolts, gaskets)
3. Missing or out-of-date drawings
4. Unclear weld procedure references
5. Missing permit requirements
6. Inadequate safety/hazard information
7. Unrealistic labor estimates

### 5.4 Constraint Clearance Checklist

| Constraint | Cleared | Date |

| Materials kitted | [ ] | |
| Scaffold available | [ ] | |
| Predecessor work complete | [ ] | |
| Permits obtained | [ ] | |
