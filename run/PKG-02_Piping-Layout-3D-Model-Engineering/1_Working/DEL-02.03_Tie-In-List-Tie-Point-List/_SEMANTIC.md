# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.03 Tie-In List / Tie Point List

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Tie-In List serves as the authoritative register of all physical connection points where new piping systems integrate with existing facility infrastructure, enabling coordinated planning for isolation, execution sequencing, and operational continuity. This deliverable carries knowledge about interface locations, connection specifications, and shutdown requirements to facilitate safe brownfield construction without compromising the integrity of live systems.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For Tie-In List specifically, these lenses help structure questions about:
  - **Interface identification** (what connections exist)
  - **Location specification** (where connections occur)
  - **Isolation planning** (how connections are safely made)
  - **Execution sequencing** (when connections are performed)
  - **Coordination requirements** (who must be involved)
