# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.24 Piping Material Class (PMC) Verification Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the verification basis by which piping material classes are assessed against governing codes and standards, ensuring that material specifications, pressure-temperature ratings, and component selections meet regulatory and design requirements. It provides a traceable record of compliance status and discrepancy resolutions that underpin the integrity of piping material selection decisions.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
