# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.05 Piping Site Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable produces drawing(s) that communicate the spatial arrangement of piping routes across a facility site, serving as the primary coordination and construction reference for piping installation. It must carry knowledge about above-ground and below-ground routing, equipment connections, tie-in points, and coordination with other disciplines, enabling stakeholders to understand piping layout at a site-wide level.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
