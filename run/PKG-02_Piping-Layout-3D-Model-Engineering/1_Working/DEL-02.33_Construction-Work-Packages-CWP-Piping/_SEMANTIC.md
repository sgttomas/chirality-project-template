# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.33 Construction Work Packages (CWP) - Piping

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Construction Work Packages (CWPs) for piping exist to partition the piping installation scope into logically bounded, sequenceable work units that carry the engineering information (drawings, isometrics, materials, constraints) necessary for construction planning and field execution. The CWP serves as the bridge between engineering deliverables and field-installable work packages, enabling coordinated material delivery, crew allocation, and construction sequencing while supporting downstream FIWP development.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
