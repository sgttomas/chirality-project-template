| 3.4.5 | Distribute to FIWP development team | Work Package Coordinator |

### 3.5 Maintenance

| Step | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 3.5.1 | Update CWP for IFC drawing revisions | Piping Engineer |
| 3.5.2 | Update constraints as they are resolved | Work Package Coordinator |
| 3.5.3 | Track CWP completion status | Construction Planner |
| 3.5.4 | Close CWP when all work complete | Construction Manager |

## 4. Verification

### 4.1 Quality Checks

| Check | Criteria | Method |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Completeness | All required sections populated | Checklist review |
| Boundaries | Clear and non-overlapping | Cross-CWP review |
| Drawing Coverage | All IFC drawings assigned | Drawing list audit |
| Material Alignment | MTO matches CWP scope | MTO reconciliation |
| Schedule Integration | CWP aligned with schedule | Schedule review |

### 4.2 Review and Approval

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Piping Engineer | Prepare CWP content |
| Work Package Coordinator | Coordinate and compile |
| Piping Lead | Engineering approval |
| Construction Manager | Construction approval |
