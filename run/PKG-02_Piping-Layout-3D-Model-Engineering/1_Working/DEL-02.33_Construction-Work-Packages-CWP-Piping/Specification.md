# Specification: Construction Work Packages (CWP) - Piping

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the requirements for developing Construction Work Packages (CWPs) for piping installation scope on the Puget Sound Optimization Project.

### 1.2 Applicability
- All new piping associated with booster pump installation
- Manifold piping systems
- Tie-in connections to existing systems
- Associated pipe supports and accessories

### 1.3 Exclusions
- Vendor package internal piping
- Instrument tubing (covered under Instrumentation package)
- Electrical conduit

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Content Requirements
Each CWP shall include:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| REQ-01 | CWP cover sheet with unique identifier and scope description |
| REQ-02 | Clear geographic and system boundary definition |
| REQ-03 | Complete list of IFC drawings applicable to the CWP |
| REQ-04 | Index of piping isometrics included |
| REQ-05 | Material summary/MTO for CWP scope |
| REQ-06 | Weld count and breakdown by type |
| REQ-07 | Equipment served by piping in CWP scope |
| REQ-08 | Constraints and interface requirements |
| REQ-09 | Predecessor/successor CWP relationships |
| REQ-10 | Mechanical completion and turnover requirements |

### 2.2 Format Requirements
- Compiled as document package (PDF + native files)
- Consistent numbering system for CWPs
- Cross-referenced to FIWPs
- Aligned with construction schedule

### 2.3 Boundary Requirements
- CWP boundaries shall be clearly defined (geographic, system, or equipment-based)
- Boundaries shall align with logical construction sequences
- Boundaries shall facilitate efficient FIWP development
- Overlapping scope between CWPs shall be avoided

### 2.4 Integration Requirements
- CWPs shall align with project schedule activities
- CWPs shall support material delivery sequencing
- CWPs shall coordinate with other discipline CWPs
- CWPs shall feed into FIWP development

## 3. Standards

|----------|-------------|
| CII Best Practices | Advanced Work Packaging (AWP) methodology (**ASSUMPTION**) |
| TM Standards | TM Construction Work Package requirements (**TBD**) |
| Project Procedure | Construction execution plan (**TBD**) |

## 4. Verification

### 4.1 Verification Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Completeness Check | All required content present |
