# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.04 Piping Key Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Piping Key Plan exists to establish spatial orientation and drawing navigation for the piping engineering drawing set. It must carry knowledge of site boundaries, coordinate grids, major equipment locations, piping corridors, area designations, and drawing coverage indexing that enables coherent navigation between overview and detail drawings.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For the Piping Key Plan specifically, consider how each lens illuminates questions about:
  - Site boundary and grid system establishment (orientation lenses)
  - Drawing index completeness and match-line coordination (formulation/requirements lenses)
  - Navigation clarity and maintainability (objectives/evaluation lenses)
  - Cross-discipline coordination and standard conformance (verification lenses)
