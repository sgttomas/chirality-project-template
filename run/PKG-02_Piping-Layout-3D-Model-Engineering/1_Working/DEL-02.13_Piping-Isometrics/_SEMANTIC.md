# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.13 Piping Isometrics

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Piping Isometrics exist to provide a complete fabrication and installation knowledge record for piping systems, carrying dimensional geometry, material specifications, weld traceability, testing requirements, and finishing requirements in a form that enables shop fabrication, field installation, quality verification, and lifecycle documentation without requiring additional interpretation or external queries.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for DEL-02.13 Piping Isometrics.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The Piping Isometrics deliverable perspective conditions all matrices: fabrication knowledge, dimensional accuracy, weld traceability, testing requirements, and finishing requirements for shop fabrication, field installation, and lifecycle documentation.
