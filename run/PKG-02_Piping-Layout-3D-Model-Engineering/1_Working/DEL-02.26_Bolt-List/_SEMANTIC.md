# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.26 Bolt List

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Bolt List serves as the authoritative registry of fastener assemblies for pressure-containing pipe joints, providing the categorical and specification data necessary to ensure material traceability, procurement accuracy, and compliant installation across all bolted connections within the piping scope.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
