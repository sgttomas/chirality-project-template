# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.06 Piping Demolition Site Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Piping Demolition Site Plan exists to communicate spatial and functional removal boundaries for existing piping infrastructure, enabling safe and coordinated brownfield construction through clear identification of what must be removed versus preserved, with precise tie-in delineation and cross-discipline alignment.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for DEL-02.06 Piping Demolition Site Plan.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For this demolition site plan deliverable, key semantic categories include:
  - **Normative dimension:** regulatory compliance for demolition scope (CSA Z662, TM standards)
  - **Operative dimension:** procedural execution of demolition documentation (CAD production, field verification, coordination)
  - **Evaluative dimension:** quality criteria for demolition drawings (clarity, completeness, constructability)
