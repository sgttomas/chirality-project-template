## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the requirements for the Piping Demolition Site Plan drawing(s) to be developed as part of the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO) at Sumas Tank Farm. The demolition site plan shall clearly identify all existing piping, valves, and associated equipment to be removed or modified to facilitate installation of the new booster pump station and 5x6 manifold.

### 1.2 Scope
The Piping Demolition Site Plan shall cover:
- All existing piping within the project footprint requiring removal
- Existing valves and inline equipment to be demolished
- Cut points and tie-in locations for new piping connections
- Coordination boundaries with civil/structural demolition scope
- Preservation requirements for existing piping/equipment to remain

### 1.3 Exclusions
- Hot tap and tie-in execution activities (by others per SOW)
- Civil/structural demolition drawings (covered under PKG-04)
- Detailed demolition procedures (covered under construction work packages)

| Piping | Align with new piping site plan (DEL-02.05) |
| Civil/Structural | Coordinate structural demolition (DEL-04.24) |
| Mechanical | Coordinate equipment removal |
| 3D Model | Represent demolition in 3D model (DEL-02.28) |

#### 2.3.2 Existing Conditions Verification
- Site verification required to confirm existing conditions
- Laser scan data or as-built drawings to be used as basis
- Discrepancies between as-builts and field conditions to be documented and resolved

## 3. Quality Requirements

### 3.1 Accuracy Requirements
| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Dimensional accuracy | Per survey/laser scan tolerance |
| Completeness | All demolition scope items identified |
| Consistency | Aligned with P&IDs and other drawings |

### 3.2 Checking Requirements
- Internal discipline check per DEL-00.03 (Deliverable Review & Verification Plan)
- Inter-discipline check with Process, Civil/Structural, and Mechanical
- Compliance check against TM CAD standards

### 3.3 Deliverable Quality Criteria
