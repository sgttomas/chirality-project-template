## Assumptions
1. ASSUMPTION: Existing as-built drawings and/or laser scan data will be provided by TM to support demolition scope identification.
2. ASSUMPTION: Demolition boundaries will be confirmed during FEED based on final equipment layout.
3. ASSUMPTION: Hot tap and tie-in execution activities are by others per SOW-0249.

## TBD Items
1. TBD: Specific TM CAD standards and drawing templates.
2. TBD: Laser scan data or as-built drawings for existing conditions.
3. TBD: Confirmed list of existing equipment/piping to be demolished.
4. TBD: Demolition sequencing requirements (if any).
