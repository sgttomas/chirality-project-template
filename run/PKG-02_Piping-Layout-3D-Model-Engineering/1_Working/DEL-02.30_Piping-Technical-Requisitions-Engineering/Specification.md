# Specification: DEL-02.30 Piping Technical Requisitions (Engineering)

## Scope

### Purpose
Piping Technical Requisitions provide the technical basis for procurement of piping materials, valves, specialty items, and related equipment for the PSO project at Sumas Tank Farm. These packages enable competitive bidding by qualified vendors and ensure procured items meet design requirements.

### Boundaries
- **Included:**
  - Technical requisition packages for piping scope materials and equipment
  - Technical specifications, datasheets, and drawings
  - Quality and documentation requirements
  - Regulatory compliance requirements (CRN, ABSA, BCSA)
  - Technical bid evaluation support
- **Excluded:**
  - Commercial terms and conditions (provided by TM Procurement)
  - Purchase order issuance (TM responsibility)
  - Vendor management (TM responsibility)
  - Process equipment requisitions (covered by PKG-01)
  - Mechanical equipment requisitions (covered by PKG-03)

### Deliverables
- Technical requisition packages (Word/PDF with attachments)
- Technical specifications (per TM or project standards)
- Datasheets (process and mechanical data)
- Reference drawings
- Technical bid evaluation reports (as requested)
