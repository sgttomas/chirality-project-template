# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.30 Piping Technical Requisitions (Engineering)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Piping Technical Requisitions exist to provide complete, technically accurate procurement packages that translate engineering design requirements into vendor-ready documentation, enabling competitive bidding and ensuring procured piping materials, valves, and specialty items meet design specifications, code compliance, and regulatory requirements.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
