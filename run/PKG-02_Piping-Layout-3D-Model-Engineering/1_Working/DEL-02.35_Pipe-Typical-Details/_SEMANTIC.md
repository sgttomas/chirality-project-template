# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.35 Pipe Typical Details

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Pipe Typical Details serve as the standardized visual reference repository that encodes repeatable installation, fabrication, and configuration knowledge for piping components, supports, and accessories, enabling consistent execution across all project piping systems. This deliverable translates code requirements, material specifications, and construction practices into clear graphical instructions that bridge engineering intent with field and shop implementation.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
