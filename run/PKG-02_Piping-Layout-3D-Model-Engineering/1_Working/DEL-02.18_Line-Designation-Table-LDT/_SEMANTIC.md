# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.18 Line Designation Table (LDT)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Line Designation Table serves as the authoritative registry of all process piping line attributes, providing the structured data bridge between process design intent (P&IDs, design basis) and downstream engineering outputs (isometrics, material takeoffs, testing packages). It must carry complete line identification, design conditions, material specifications, examination requirements, and testing parameters sufficient for fabrication and construction coordination.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
