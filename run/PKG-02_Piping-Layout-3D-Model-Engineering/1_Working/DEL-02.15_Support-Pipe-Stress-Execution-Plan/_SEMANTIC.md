## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable (Support & Pipe Stress Execution Plan).
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The perspective (pipe stress methodology and support design framework) conditions all matrix interpretations.
