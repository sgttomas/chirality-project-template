# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.20 Piping Specialty Items Datasheets & Specifications

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the technical knowledge framework for piping specialty items, capturing the design parameters, material specifications, and performance requirements that enable accurate procurement and fabrication of non-standard piping components. It serves as the authoritative record translating process requirements into vendor-actionable specifications.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
