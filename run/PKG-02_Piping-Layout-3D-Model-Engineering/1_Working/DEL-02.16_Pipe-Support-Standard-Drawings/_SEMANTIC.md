# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.16 Pipe Support Standard Drawings

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Pipe Support Standard Drawings deliverable exists to establish the standardized graphical and technical definitions for each category of pipe support used within the project scope. This deliverable must carry knowledge of support geometry, material specification, load capacity, and fabrication requirements that enable consistent support selection, procurement, fabrication, and installation across all piping systems.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
