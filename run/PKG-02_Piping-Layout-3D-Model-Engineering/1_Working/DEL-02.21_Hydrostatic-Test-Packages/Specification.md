# Specification: Hydrostatic Test Packages

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the requirements for developing hydrostatic test packages for all new piping within the Puget Sound Optimization Project at Sumas Tank Farm.

### 1.2 Applicability
- All new piping associated with booster pump installation
- New 5x6 manifold piping
- Tie-in connections requiring field hydrotesting
- Piping modifications within project scope

### 1.3 Exclusions
- Existing piping not modified by this project
- Vendor package internal piping (tested by vendor)
- Instrument tubing (unless specified)
- Pre-tested shop fabricated spools (with valid certificates)

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Package Content Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| REQ-01 | Each package shall include test boundary drawing with color coding |
| REQ-02 | Test pressure shall be calculated per ASME B31.3 or CSA Z662 as applicable |
| REQ-03 | All vent and drain locations shall be identified |
| REQ-04 | Water supply source and volume shall be specified |
| REQ-05 | Water disposal plan shall be included |
| REQ-06 | Blind and isolation list shall be provided |
| REQ-07 | Equipment requiring isolation shall be identified |
| REQ-08 | Temporary supports for test loads shall be identified |

### 2.2 Test Pressure Requirements (**ASSUMPTION** - per ASME B31.3)

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| REQ-09 | Minimum test pressure: 1.5 x Design Pressure |
| REQ-10 | Maximum test pressure: Limited by weakest component in test boundary |
| REQ-11 | Test pressure adjusted for temperature if test temp < design temp |
| REQ-12 | Relief valves shall be removed or isolated during test |

### 2.3 Drawing Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| REQ-13 | Test boundaries clearly marked with unique test number |
| REQ-14 | Color coding per project standard (**TBD**) |
| REQ-15 | Vent and drain symbols clearly indicated |
| REQ-16 | Blind locations marked with symbol and size |
| REQ-17 | Drawing shall reference applicable piping isometrics |

### 2.4 Format Requirements
- Drawing format per project CAD standards
- Supporting documentation in PDF and native formats
- Test package index for tracking multiple packages
- Compatible with Construction Work Package structure

## 3. Standards

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| CSA Z662 | Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems (**ASSUMPTION**) |
| ASME PCC-2 | Repair of Pressure Equipment and Piping |
| TM-SPEC-HT-001 | TM Hydrotest Specification (**TBD**) |
| API 570 | Piping Inspection Code (reference) |

## 4. Verification

### 4.1 Verification Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Calculation Check | Verify test pressure calculations |
| Drawing Review | Check boundaries against P&IDs and isometrics |
| Completeness Check | Verify all required package elements included |
| Constructability Review | Review with Construction for feasibility |

### 4.2 Acceptance Criteria
