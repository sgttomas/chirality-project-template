# Specification: Pipeline Alignment Drawings

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the requirements for developing pipeline alignment drawings for the Puget Sound Optimization Project at Sumas Tank Farm, where applicable to new pipeline construction.

### 1.2 Applicability
- New pipeline segments from booster pump station to manifold (**ASSUMPTION**)
- Sections/profiles for buried or special routing
- Crossing details at roads, utilities, waterways
- Tie-in connections to existing pipeline infrastructure

### 1.3 Exclusions
- Above-ground piping within facility (covered by DEL-02.12 GA Drawings)
- Existing Trans Mountain mainline pipeline
- Vendor package piping
