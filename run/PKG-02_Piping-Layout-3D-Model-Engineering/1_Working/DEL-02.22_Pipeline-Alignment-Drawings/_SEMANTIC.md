# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.22 Pipeline Alignment Drawings

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Pipeline Alignment Drawings exist to communicate the spatial positioning and geometric configuration of pipeline routes such that survey-based horizontal and vertical alignments, crossing details, and construction parameters can be verified, coordinated across disciplines, and executed in the field.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
