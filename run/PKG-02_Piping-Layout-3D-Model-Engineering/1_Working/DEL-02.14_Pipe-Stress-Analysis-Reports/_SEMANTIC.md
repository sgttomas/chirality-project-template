# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.14 Pipe Stress Analysis Report(s)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to document the engineering verification of piping system mechanical integrity through flexibility analysis, code compliance demonstration, equipment nozzle load verification, and support load determination. It serves as the authoritative technical record linking piping design decisions to code-mandated stress limits and equipment protection requirements.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable (Pipe Stress Analysis Reports).
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For pipe stress analysis, key semantic partitions include:
  - **Normative dimension:** Code compliance (CSA Z662, ASME B31.3), equipment nozzle allowables, stress acceptance criteria
  - **Operative dimension:** Analysis methodology, model building procedures, load case execution, support load calculation
  - **Evaluative dimension:** Stress ratio assessment, nozzle load utilization, existing system impact verification, pass/fail determination
