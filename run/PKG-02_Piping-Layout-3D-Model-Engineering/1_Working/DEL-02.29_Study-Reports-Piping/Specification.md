# Specification: DEL-02.29 Study Report(s) (Piping)

## Scope

### Purpose
Piping Study Reports document engineering studies conducted during detailed design to address specific technical questions, evaluate alternatives, and support design decisions for the PSO project at Sumas Tank Farm. These reports provide technical justification for design choices and document resolution of design challenges.

### Boundaries
- **Included:**
  - Engineering studies specific to piping scope
  - Technical investigations to support design decisions
  - Studies arising from HAZOP or design review actions
  - Studies required by TM or regulatory authorities
  - Brownfield tie-in methodology studies
  - Constructability assessments for piping scope
- **Excluded:**
  - Routine calculations (covered by specific calculation deliverables)
  - Pipe stress analysis (covered by DEL-02.14)
  - Hydraulic analysis (covered by DEL-01.07)
  - Process studies (covered by PKG-01)
  - Equipment studies (covered by PKG-03)

### Deliverables
- Individual study reports (Word native, PDF for issue)
- Supporting calculations and data (appendices)
- Study register/log (tracking all piping studies)
