# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.29 Study Report(s) (Piping)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Piping Study Reports serve as documented technical investigations that address specific design challenges, evaluate alternatives, and provide actionable recommendations to support engineering decisions during detailed design. The deliverable must carry knowledge of analytical methodology, design rationale, and recommendation traceability to ensure design decisions are defensible and implementable.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens ≠ authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
