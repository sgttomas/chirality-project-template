# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.08 Overall Plot Plan

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Overall Plot Plan provides a comprehensive spatial representation of project scope, establishing the relationship between new and existing facilities, defining project boundaries, and serving as the primary visual reference for understanding facility arrangement and spatial coordination across disciplines.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for the Overall Plot Plan deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The Overall Plot Plan perspective emphasizes spatial representation, facility relationships, project scope boundaries, and visual communication across disciplines.
