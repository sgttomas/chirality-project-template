## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Guidance
This document provides guidance for developing the Overall Plot Plan for the Puget Sound Optimization Project (PSO). It supplements the Specification and Procedure documents with practical advice for producing a comprehensive plot plan that effectively communicates the project scope.

- CAD Technicians
- Project Engineers
- Discipline Leads
- Design Review Participants
- Client Representatives

## 2. Key Considerations

### 2.1 Understanding the Plot Plan Role
The Overall Plot Plan serves as the primary reference drawing for understanding project scope and facility arrangement:

**Primary Functions:**
- Executive summary of project scope in graphical form
- Context for detailed area and equipment drawings
- Basis for regulatory submissions and permits
- Communication tool for stakeholders
- Reference for construction planning

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Balance between overview clarity and necessary detail
- Consistent representation with existing TM drawings
- Clear distinction between existing and new facilities
- Appropriate scale for complete project coverage

### 2.2 Project Scope Elements
The PSO project includes the following major elements to be shown:

| Element | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Five VS6 Booster Pumps | 2 large, 2 small, 1 medium capacity | SOW Section 2.3.1.2 |
| 5x6 Manifold | Suction and discharge manifold system | SOW Section 2.3.1.1 |
| Containment Wall | Secondary containment for pump/manifold area | SOW Section 2.3.1.1 |
| Electrical Building | VFDs, MCCs, and controls | SOW Section 3.1.5.1 |
| Sump Tank System | Containment drainage and reinjection | SOW Section 3.2.3.10 |
| Major Piping | Connections to existing Tank TK-102 | SOW Section 2.3.1.1 |

### 2.3 Coordination with Related Deliverables

| Deliverable | Coordination Need |
|-------------|------------------|
| DEL-02.04 (Key Plan) | Sheet coverage and drawing organization |
| DEL-02.05 (Piping Site Plan) | Consistency of piping representation |
| DEL-02.09 (Area Plans) | Match lines and detail boundaries |
| DEL-02.10 (Equipment Layout Plans) | Equipment location consistency |
| DEL-04.06 (Civil Site Plans) | Roads, grading, drainage alignment |
| DEL-04.21 (Containment Plans) | Containment boundary consistency |
| DEL-06.12 (Area Classification) | Hazardous area boundaries |

## 3. Best Practices

### 3.1 Drawing Development

#### 3.1.1 Scale Selection
- Choose scale to show complete project on single sheet if possible
- Typical scales: 1:500 for moderate sites, 1:1000 for larger coverage
- Consider readability of labels and symbols at chosen scale
- Include graphic scale bar for reproduction flexibility

#### 3.1.2 Existing vs. New Differentiation
- Use consistent symbology to distinguish existing from new
- Options include: line weight, line type, shading, hatching
- ASSUMPTION: Grey/screened for existing, black/bold for new is common practice
- Maintain legend explaining all symbology

#### 3.1.3 Level of Detail
- Show major features without excessive detail
- Use simplified representations for equipment
- Reference detailed drawings for specific information
- Avoid cluttering with dimensions (reference coordinates instead)

#### 3.1.4 Context and Boundaries
- Show sufficient existing context for orientation
- Include adjacent tanks and facilities for reference
- Clearly delineate project battery limits
- Show property/lease boundaries if applicable

### 3.2 Content Organization

#### 3.2.1 Drawing Layout
- Position north consistently (typically up or to right)
- Include title block, legend, notes, and references
- Provide adequate margins for reproduction
- Consider printing and folding requirements

#### 3.2.2 Reference System
- Show coordinate grid with labeled gridlines
- Include elevation reference datum
- Provide match lines to area plans
- Cross-reference to key plan and drawing index

#### 3.2.3 Notes and Legend
- Complete legend for all symbols used
- General notes for drawing interpretation
- References to related drawings
- Revision notes and change tracking

### 3.3 Quality Considerations

#### 3.3.1 Self-Check Questions
Before submitting for review, verify:
- [ ] Complete project scope represented?
- [ ] Existing vs. new clearly differentiated?
- [ ] All major facilities shown and labeled?
- [ ] Coordinate grid complete and labeled?
- [ ] Match lines to area plans included?
- [ ] Battery limits clearly defined?
- [ ] Legend complete and accurate?
- [ ] Drawing references correct?

#### 3.3.2 Common Issues to Avoid
| Issue | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Overcrowded drawing | Use appropriate scale, simplify details |
| Missing facilities | Cross-check against project scope summary |
| Inconsistent with detailed drawings | Extract from 3D model after coordination |
| Unclear existing/new distinction | Use consistent, well-defined symbology |
| Missing references | Complete all cross-references systematically |

## 4. Common Challenges and Solutions

### 4.1 Balancing Detail and Clarity
**Challenge:** Showing adequate information without overwhelming the drawing.

**Solutions:**
- Focus on location and extent, not internal details
- Use simple equipment symbols at plot plan scale
- Reference area plans and equipment layouts for detail
- Consider inset views for complex areas if needed

### 4.2 Integrating Multiple Disciplines
**Challenge:** Coordinating input from piping, civil, structural, electrical.

**Solutions:**
- Establish clear responsibilities for each element
- Use 3D model as single source of coordinated layout
- Hold regular coordination meetings during development
- Issue draft for discipline review before formal IFR

### 4.3 Representing Hazardous Areas
**Challenge:** Showing area classification on plot plan without cluttering.

**Solutions:**
- Consider separate hazardous area drawing (DEL-06.12)
- If shown on plot plan, use subtle symbology (boundary lines only)
- Reference hazardous area drawing for detailed classification
- Coordinate with electrical discipline for consistent representation

### 4.4 Incorporating Design Changes
**Challenge:** Plot plan must stay current as design evolves.

**Solutions:**
- Establish plot plan as key coordination document
- Update plot plan with each design revision cycle
- Use change management to track layout changes
- Maintain traceability to 3D model

## 5. Review and Approval

### 5.1 Internal Review Focus Areas
| Reviewer | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| Piping Lead | Complete scope representation, layout optimization |
| Civil Lead | Roads, grading, drainage alignment |
| Structural Lead | Building and foundation locations |
| Electrical Lead | Electrical building, area classification |
| Process Lead | Overall arrangement meets process needs |
| Project Engineer | Complete scope, stakeholder communication |

### 5.2 Client Review Considerations
- Plot plan often used for executive presentations
- Ensure clear communication of project scope
- Highlight key features and boundaries
- Address any regulatory or permit requirements

## 6. Documentation and Traceability

### 6.1 Records to Maintain
- Working files and coordination drafts
- Discipline review comments and resolutions
- Layout change history
- Coordination meeting notes

### 6.2 Cross-References
Ensure proper cross-referencing to:
- Area plans (DEL-02.09)
- Equipment layout plans (DEL-02.10)
- Piping site plan (DEL-02.05)
- Civil site plans (DEL-04.06)
- 3D model (DEL-02.28)
