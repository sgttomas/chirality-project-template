# Procedure: Specification Deviations (Piping)

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Objective
This procedure defines the steps for identifying, documenting, submitting, and tracking specification deviations for piping scope on the Puget Sound Optimization Project.

### 1.2 Scope
Applicable to all piping-related deviations from TM standards and specifications within the PSO project at Sumas Tank Farm.

## 2. Prerequisites

| Design Documents | Various | As applicable |
| Deviation Register Template | Project Standard | Approved |

### 2.2 Resources Required
- Piping Engineer (Lead)
- Piping Lead (approval authority)
- Document Control (register maintenance)
- TM Representative (final approval)

### 2.3 Training Requirements
- Familiarity with TM standards and specifications
- Understanding of project deviation approval process
- Knowledge of risk assessment methodology

## 3. Steps

### 3.1 Deviation Identification

| Step | Action | Responsible |

| 3.1.1 | Identify requirement that cannot be met per TM standard | Piping Engineer |
| 3.1.2 | Verify that deviation is required (not an interpretation issue) | Piping Engineer |
| 3.1.3 | Document the specific TM standard clause/section | Piping Engineer |
| 3.1.4 | Notify Piping Lead of potential deviation | Piping Engineer |

### 3.2 Deviation Documentation

| Step | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 3.2.1 | Assign unique deviation ID per project numbering | Document Control |
| 3.2.2 | Complete deviation description in register | Piping Engineer |
| 3.2.3 | Prepare technical justification | Piping Engineer |
| 3.2.4 | Perform and document risk assessment | Piping Engineer |
| 3.2.5 | Propose alternative or compensating measure | Piping Engineer |
| 3.2.6 | Identify all affected documents and drawings | Piping Engineer |

### 3.3 Internal Review

| Step | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 3.3.1 | Review deviation for technical adequacy | Piping Lead |
| 3.3.2 | Review risk assessment for completeness | QA Representative |
| 3.3.3 | Review impact on project schedule/cost | Project Manager |
| 3.3.4 | Approve for submission to TM | Engineering Manager |

### 3.4 Submission and Approval

| Step | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 3.4.1 | Submit deviation to TM via formal transmittal | Document Control |
| 3.4.2 | Track submission in deviation register | Document Control |
| 3.4.3 | Respond to TM clarification requests | Piping Engineer |
| 3.4.4 | Document TM approval/rejection in register | Document Control |
| 3.4.5 | If rejected, develop alternative approach | Piping Engineer |

### 3.5 Implementation and Closeout

| Step | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 3.5.1 | Verify TM approval before implementing deviation | Piping Lead |
| 3.5.2 | Update affected documents and drawings | Piping Designer |
| 3.5.3 | Notify affected disciplines of approved deviation | Piping Engineer |
| 3.5.4 | Update deviation status to Closed | Document Control |
| 3.5.5 | Retain approval documentation per project records | Document Control |

## 4. Verification

### 4.1 Quality Checks

| Check | Criteria | Method |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Completeness | All required fields populated | Review checklist |
| Justification | Technical basis is adequate | Piping Lead review |
| Risk Assessment | Appropriate for deviation severity | QA review |
| Approval Status | Documented TM approval | Register audit |

### 4.2 Review and Approval

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Piping Engineer | Prepare deviation package |
| Piping Lead | Technical review and endorsement |
| Engineering Manager | Approve for TM submission |
| TM Representative | Final approval authority |

## 5. Records

### 5.1 Records Generated

| Record | Format | Retention |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Deviation Register | Excel + PDF | Project life + 10 years |
| TM Approval Correspondence | PDF/Email | Project life + 10 years |
| Risk Assessments | PDF | Project life + 10 years |
| Supporting Calculations | PDF | Project life + 10 years |

### 5.2 Document Control

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Numbering** | DEV-PIP-### (sequential) |
| **Revision Control** | Register revision tracked with each update |
| **Distribution** | Per project distribution matrix |
| **Storage** | Project document management system |

### 5.3 Status Definitions

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Open | Deviation identified, documentation in progress |
| Under Review | Submitted to TM, awaiting response |
| Approved | TM approval received |
| Approved with Conditions | TM approval with specific conditions |
| Rejected | TM rejected deviation |
| Closed | Deviation implemented and documents updated |
