# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.31 Specification Deviations (Piping)

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides the structured register for tracking deviations from owner standards in piping design, serving to ensure all non-conformances are identified, justified, approved, and traceable. It carries the knowledge needed to maintain design integrity through formal variance management while preserving accountability and regulatory compliance.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
