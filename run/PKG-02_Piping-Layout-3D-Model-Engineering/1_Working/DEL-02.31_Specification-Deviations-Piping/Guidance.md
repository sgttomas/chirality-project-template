# Guidance: Specification Deviations (Piping)

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent
This guidance document provides direction on identifying, documenting, and managing piping specification deviations for the Puget Sound Optimization Project, addressing practical considerations and project-specific requirements.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Piping Engineers
- Piping Lead
- Quality Assurance personnel
- Document Controllers
- Project Management

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compliance First** | The default approach is full compliance with TM standards |
| **Justified Deviations** | All deviations must have clear technical or commercial justification |
| **Risk-Based** | Deviations require risk assessment proportional to impact |
| **Transparent Approval** | All approvals must be documented and traceable |
| **No Implementation Without Approval** | Deviations shall not be implemented until TM approval is obtained |

### 2.2 Deviation Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Material Deviation** | Use of materials different from PMC | Alternative alloy, gasket type |
| **Dimensional Deviation** | Deviations from standard dimensions | Wall thickness, flange rating |
| **Fabrication Deviation** | Deviations from fabrication requirements | Welding procedure, PWHT |
| **Testing Deviation** | Deviations from testing requirements | Test pressure, NDE extent |
| **Design Deviation** | Deviations from design standards | Support spacing, routing |

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Project-Specific Considerations

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Brownfield Integration** | Deviations may be required to match existing Sumas Tank Farm systems |
| **Vendor Packages** | Pump packages may have vendor-standard components requiring deviation |
| **Material Availability** | Long-lead material constraints may necessitate alternatives |
| **Constructability** | Field conditions may require deviation from standard details |

### 3.2 Technical Considerations

| Topic | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| **Safety Impact** | Any deviation affecting pressure containment or safety requires formal risk assessment |
| **Operability Impact** | Consider impact on maintenance access and procedures |
| **Future Compatibility** | Consider spare parts and future modifications |
| **Documentation Impact** | Ensure affected documents are updated to reflect approved deviations |

### 3.3 Approval Timing
- Submit deviations as early as possible to avoid design delays
- Group related deviations for efficient review
- Allow adequate TM review time in project schedule
- Escalate delayed approvals to project management

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Deviation Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Submit Early** | Allows time for review and alternatives | May not have complete information |
| **Submit Complete** | Better technical justification | May cause schedule delays |
| **Verbal Pre-Approval** | Faster initial response | Risk of misunderstanding, requires follow-up |

### 4.2 Common Deviation Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Material Substitution** | Demonstrate equivalent or better properties; reference code allowances |
| **Reduced Testing** | Justify based on service criticality and code minimums |
| **Alternative Fabrication** | Demonstrate equivalent quality outcome |
| **Existing System Match** | Reference operational history and justify continued use |

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Sample Deviation Register Entry

| Field | Example Value |
|-------|---------------|
| Deviation ID | DEV-PIP-001 |
| Date Raised | 2026-02-15 |
| TM Standard/Spec | TM-SPEC-PMC-A1A1 (**TBD**) |
| Clause/Section | Section 4.2.3 |
| Deviation Description | Use of spiral-wound gaskets instead of ring-type joint gaskets for Class 600 flanges |
| Justification | Equivalent sealing performance demonstrated; improved availability and reduced installation time |
| Risk Assessment | Low risk - equivalent pressure rating; no safety impact |
| Proposed Alternative | Spiral-wound with inner/outer rings per ASME B16.20 |
| Status | Under Review |

### 5.2 Common Issues to Avoid
1. Implementing deviations before obtaining TM approval
2. Incomplete justification or missing risk assessment
3. Failure to update affected documents after approval
4. Verbal-only approvals without written confirmation
5. Missing cross-references to affected drawings/specs

### 5.3 Escalation Path
```
Piping Engineer (identifies deviation)
    └── Piping Lead (technical review)
            └── Engineering Manager (approval to submit)
                    └── TM Representative (final approval)
```
