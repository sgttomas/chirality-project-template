# Specification: Specification Deviations (Piping)

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the requirements for developing and maintaining the Specification Deviations Register for piping-related deviations from TM standards and specifications on the Puget Sound Optimization Project.

### 1.2 Applicability
- All new piping associated with booster pump installation
- Modified existing piping systems
- Piping material class selections
- Fabrication and testing methods
- All piping specialty items

### 1.3 Exclusions
- Process-related deviations (covered under DEL-01.14)
- Instrumentation deviations (covered under PKG-05)
- Electrical deviations (covered under PKG-04)

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Content Requirements
The Deviation Register shall include:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| REQ-01 | Unique deviation identifier for each entry |
| REQ-02 | Clear reference to TM standard/specification section |
| REQ-03 | Complete description of the deviation |
| REQ-04 | Technical justification for the deviation |
| REQ-05 | Risk assessment covering safety, operability, and maintainability |
| REQ-06 | Proposed alternative or compensating measure |
| REQ-07 | Approval status and TM approval reference |
| REQ-08 | Cross-reference to affected drawings and documents |

### 2.2 Format Requirements
- Excel spreadsheet format with standardized columns
- Sortable and filterable by status, date, and discipline
- Version control and revision tracking
- Hyperlinks to supporting documentation where applicable

### 2.3 Approval Requirements
- All deviations shall be submitted to TM for approval
- No deviation shall be implemented without documented TM approval
- Verbal approvals shall be followed up with written confirmation
- Conditional approvals shall clearly state all conditions

### 2.4 Compliance Requirements
- Deviations shall not compromise code compliance (ASME B31.3, CSA Z662)
- Safety-critical deviations require formal risk assessment
- Deviations affecting equipment ratings require engineering review

## 3. Standards

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| TM Standards | TM Piping Specifications (**TBD** - not provided in workspace) |
| ASME B31.3 | Process Piping (**ASSUMPTION**) |
| CSA Z662 | Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems (**ASSUMPTION**) |
| SOW Reference | SOW Section 3.2.2.3 - Deviation approval requirement |

## 4. Verification

### 4.1 Verification Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Review | Technical review by Lead Piping Engineer |
| Audit | Periodic audit for completeness and status accuracy |
| Cross-check | Verification that approved deviations are implemented |
| Tracking | Status tracking to ensure timely approvals |

### 4.2 Acceptance Criteria
- All deviations identified and logged prior to implementation
- 100% TM approval for all implemented deviations
- Complete justification and risk assessment for each deviation
- Clear traceability to affected documents and drawings

## 5. Documentation

### 5.1 Deliverable Format
- Native: Excel (.xlsx)
- PDF export for review/approval cycles

### 5.2 Submission Requirements
| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| FEED IFR | Initial register with identified deviations |
| FEED IFD | Updated with FEED-phase approvals |
| Detailed Design 60% | Progressive update |
| IFC | Complete register with all approvals |
| As-Built | Final register with construction deviations |
