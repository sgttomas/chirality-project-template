# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.11 Module Location Plans

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** Module Location Plans serve as spatial positioning documents that bridge detailed equipment layouts and overall site plans, depicting the location, orientation, and interface points of prefabricated modules within the facility layout. This deliverable supports construction planning and installation sequencing for modular construction approaches, enabling coordinated placement of prefabricated assemblies at brownfield sites with existing infrastructure constraints.

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens is not authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- For Module Location Plans specifically, the semantic lenses support analysis of:
  - How spatial positioning requirements align with regulatory standards (normative row)
  - How module placement procedures enable functional execution (operative row)
  - How coordination and verification activities establish value (evaluative row)
