# Procedure: DEL-02.11 Module Location Plans

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Objective
This procedure defines the step-by-step process for developing, reviewing, and issuing Module Location Plans for the PSO Project at Sumas Tank Farm.

### 1.2 Scope
- Covers the development workflow from initial layout through IFC issuance and as-built updates
- Applies to all module location drawings for the booster pump station and manifold facilities
- Addresses coordination requirements with related disciplines and deliverables

### 1.3 Conditionality
