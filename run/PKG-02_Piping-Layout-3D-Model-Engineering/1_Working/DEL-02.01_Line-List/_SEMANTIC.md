# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.01 Line List

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Line List serves as the master register of all piping elements, encoding the identity, attributes, and design conditions of each pipe segment. It must carry the knowledge necessary to trace every line from its process source through to fabrication and construction, ensuring consistency across all downstream piping deliverables.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes

- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
- The Line List perspective emphasizes traceability from process source to fabrication, consistency across downstream deliverables, and the master register function for piping identity and attributes.
