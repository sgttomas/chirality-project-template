# Semantic Lens: DEL-02.32 Piping Data Books

**Generated:** 2026-02-01
**Perspective:** The Piping Data Books deliverable exists to compile, organize, and preserve the complete documented history of piping systems from design through as-built condition, ensuring that all material certifications, fabrication records, testing evidence, and quality documentation are traceable, accessible, and compliant with regulatory and owner requirements for asset handover and lifecycle support.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra

## Application Notes
- These matrices partition the semantic space for this deliverable.
- Use as lenses when viewing Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, Procedure.
- Matrices identify types/categories; particulars are resolved downstream (e.g., in WORKING_ITEMS sessions).
- Lens does not equal authority: do not treat these as evidence for requirements or parameters.
