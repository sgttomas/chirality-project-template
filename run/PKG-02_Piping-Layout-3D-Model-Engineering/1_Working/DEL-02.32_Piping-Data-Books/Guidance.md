# Guidance: Piping Data Books

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Document Intent
This guidance document provides direction on compiling Piping Data Books for the Puget Sound Optimization Project, addressing practical considerations, industry best practices, and project-specific requirements.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Piping Engineers
- Quality Control personnel
- Document Controllers
- Construction Supervisors
- Turnover Coordinators

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Completeness** | All required documentation captured for each piping system |
| **Traceability** | Full traceability from material certification to installed location |
| **Accuracy** | As-built condition accurately reflected |
| **Accessibility** | Organized for efficient retrieval during operations |
| **Compliance** | Meets TM FD package and regulatory requirements |

### 2.2 Data Book Hierarchy

            │       └── Punch List Closeouts
            └── Supporting Documentation
                    ├── Approved Deviations
                    └── Index/Cross-Reference
```

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Project-Specific Considerations

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Booster Pump Piping** | Organize by pump (P-101 through P-105) or by system |
| **Manifold Configuration** | 5x6 manifold requires clear system identification |
| **Brownfield Integration** | Tie-in documentation shall reference existing system records |
| **Multiple Contractors** | Coordinate data book format if multiple fabrication/installation contractors |

### 3.2 Technical Considerations

| Topic | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| **Material Traceability** | Maintain chain from mill cert to heat number to cut sheet to weld map |
| **Weld Documentation** | Include weld map showing all weld numbers and welder identification |
| **NDE Coverage** | Document NDE percentage and selection method per spec |
| **Test Package Alignment** | Organize test records by hydrotest package (DEL-02.21) |

### 3.3 Coordination Requirements
- Coordinate format with TM FD package requirements (**TBD**)
- Align data book boundaries with CWP/FIWP boundaries
- Coordinate with QC for progressive documentation collection
- Align with mechanical completion and turnover milestones

## 4. Trade-offs

### 4.1 Organization Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **By System** | Aligns with operations reference | May split physical areas |
| **By Area** | Aligns with construction sequence | May split systems |
| **By Equipment** | Clear pump-by-pump organization | May duplicate common piping |

**ASSUMPTION**: Organization method to be confirmed with TM.

### 4.2 Documentation Timing

| Trade-off | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Collect Progressively vs. At End** | Collect progressively to avoid missing documents |
| **Hard Copy vs. Electronic** | Maintain electronic as master; produce hard copy at turnover |
| **Single vs. Multiple Books** | Balance completeness against practical book size |

### 5.2 Common Issues to Avoid
1. Missing or illegible material certifications
2. Incomplete weld traceability (missing heat numbers on weld log)
3. NDE reports not traceable to specific welds
4. Test records without proper witness signatures
5. As-built markups not incorporated into final drawings
6. Outstanding punch items at turnover
